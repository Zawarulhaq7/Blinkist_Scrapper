0,Emotional,Leonard Mlodinow,Emotional (2022) explores a long-misunderstood part of the human psyche: emotions. It shows how neuroscience is shedding light on the role and importance of our emotions – and gives tips on how to control our emotions to lead better lives. ,"Leonard Mlodinow, a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, is a theoretical physicist. He’s also the author of multiple best-selling books on science, including Subliminal, The Drunkard’s Walk, and The Grand Design, which he cowrote with Stephen Hawking."," A lion leaps at you from behind a tree. You haven’t eaten for two days, and you come across a colorful mushroom. Someone tries to kill you with a stone ax.  These are just a few of the urgent situations you might have encountered in prehistoric times. The early humans who developed successful responses are our ancestors. Those who failed . . . well, we find their fossils.  Emotions like fear or caution play a crucial role in how we respond to challenges in our environment. But while emotions are mostly helpful, they can get out of balance – and when that happens, our lives can spiral out of control. Society has also changed a lot since prehistoric times, so emotions that were fine-tuned to help us survive can get us in trouble today.  This Blink to Leonard Mlodinow’s Emotional dives into the modern neurological research that has transformed the way we think about emotion. It provides practical tips to help us harness our emotions – and shows how doing so can lead to more success at our jobs, better relationships with those we love, and a greater ability to accomplish our goals.  A lion leaps at you from behind a tree.

On duty during a time of great tension in the Cold War, Soviet officer Stanislav Petrov got a horrifying alert: a monitoring system had detected that the United States had just launched five intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S.S.R.  Petrov’s job was to pass this information on to his superiors, who he knew would counterstrike and start World War III. His training gave him no other option. But Petrov was reluctant to follow cold logic and launch nuclear destruction. His emotions pushed him to look for another possibility. He took a big risk and reported a system malfunction . . . which is what it turned out to be.  Although emotions can serve us well in situations like these, there’s a lot of distrust toward feelings. This mindset stems from the ancient Greeks. Western thought has long seen emotion and reason as separate spheres, with emotions clouding the clear conclusions of logic.  Traditional modern thinking on emotion evolved from this idea, with a big contribution from Charles Darwin and later theorists.  You may have heard the theory that the brain is divided into three parts: the reptilian brain, the most primitive part, which deals with basic survival instincts; the limbic system, the seat of our emotions; and the neocortex, which handles logic and is the most advanced part. The neocortex is said to control the two lower parts of the brain. There’s only one problem: just as Newton’s understanding of natural laws was upended by modern particle physics, modern neuroscience has found that the traditional thinking on our brain structure is oversimplified. Through brain scans, scientists have discovered that the interplay of instinct, emotion, and logic is far more complex and intertwined than we realized. Emotions, far from being handicaps, are key to processing our instinctive reactions and making sense of them.  This shouldn’t come as a surprise – after all, our emotions evolved to help us survive. Take, for instance, a parent’s love for their offspring. Along with our physical reflexes, like when we instinctively jerk our hand away from a hot surface, we also have emotional reflexes. Emotions give us a way to process events and use logic to build nuanced responses instead of simply reacting the same way each time. They helped Stanislav Petrov make the decision that kept the world from nuclear obliteration. Don’t discount their importance.

But there’s actually a deep neurological basis for the term “gut instinct,” as scientists discovered when they performed an astonishing experiment on mice.  Researchers separated lab mice into groups based on personality, with more adventurous mice in one group and more timid ones in another. They then transplanted gut biomes from these two groups into mice whose systems were more sterile. Here’s what happened: the mice that got the transplants from adventurous donors took on those personality traits, while the mice that got transplants from timid mice showed those traits. Who would have thought that gut bacteria could influence personality? Today, we know that the mind and body aren’t separate spheres; they operate much more as a unit. We still have a lot to learn about how our gut makeup affects us, but it’s part of a broader understanding of a body monitoring system known as the core affect. This is a constant, subconscious evaluation of our well-being based on our physical condition and our circumstances.  It’s like emotion, but more primitive – it’s a recognition of our body’s baseline state on a scale of negative to positive. This physical state can have a profound effect on our emotions.  For example, you may have noticed that you tend to be grouchy when you’re hungry or anxious when you’re tired. This is the core affect in action. When our bodies are in a negative state, like hunger, our emotions are primed to respond more negatively – and we tend to interpret things more pessimistically. Our body has decided that something is wrong, and we need to be on heightened alert for threats (like starving to death).  This has real-world consequences. Researchers have discovered that parole hearing officers are much more likely to grant parole to prisoners early in the day. As the officers get more tired and hungry, they get more strict and grant parole far less often. When they explain their decisions, though, they offer logical reasons – not an analysis of how hungry they were.  To control our thoughts and emotions, understanding our core affect is key. We already do this instinctively. This is why you reach for a glass of wine when you want to relax, or go on a run to clear your head and refresh yourself. You’re altering your body’s base state to affect your emotions. If you know that your base state has a strong impact on your emotions and decisions, you can take steps to intervene – like grabbing a snack or making sure you get plenty of rest before an important meeting.

In 1990, the obscure boxer James “Buster” Douglas took on champion Mike Tyson. Tyson was widely expected to thrash Douglas on his way to a more important boxing match. And then Douglas’s mother died right before the match. She’d been an important figure in Douglas’s life and an enthusiastic supporter of his boxing career.  The experts were right – Douglas did take a pounding. But his mother’s death helped motivate him to keep swinging and stay in the ring despite the toll of Tyson’s assault. Eventually, Douglas shocked the boxing world and knocked Tyson out in the tenth round. He’d unlocked a key to beating Tyson that other boxers soon took advantage of: if you hung in the match long enough, you could wear him down.  Determination can help all of us break through barriers. It’s what keeps us going, even through difficult times, to get what we want. People who have a lot of innate determination are “doers.” But what about the rest of us? Is it possible to rustle up our own determination? Well, yes. Here’s how it works. Two distinct neural networks, spread throughout the brain, are related to determination. The emotional salience network analyzes input and emotions, and helps us decide what’s important. The executive control network takes that information about what’s important and helps us act on it, giving us determination.  There are concrete steps you can take to help your brain adapt and change for more determination. For example, regular exercise can strengthen the executive control network. Mindfulness and meditation – paying attention to your emotions and what’s going on with your body – can also improve that network.  A lack of sleep has the opposite effect. It affects your emotional salience network, increasing negative emotions and reducing your motivation. In contrast, sleep rejuvenates that network. It makes you happier and helps you decide what’s important.  Through small changes, like getting more rest, you can help your whole system work better. This in turn will increase your determination – and allow you to accomplish more. In 1990, the obscure boxer James “Buster” Douglas took on champion Mike Tyson.

The executive control network takes that information about what’s important and helps us act on it, giving us determination.  There are concrete steps you can take to help your brain adapt and change for more determination. For example, regular exercise can strengthen the executive control network. Mindfulness and meditation – paying attention to your emotions and what’s going on with your body – can also improve that network.  A lack of sleep has the opposite effect. It affects your emotional salience network, increasing negative emotions and reducing your motivation. In contrast, sleep rejuvenates that network. It makes you happier and helps you decide what’s important.  Through small changes, like getting more rest, you can help your whole system work better. This in turn will increase your determination – and allow you to accomplish more. We’ve discovered that genes have a huge influence on people’s personalities. But does that mean you’re a prisoner of your nature? Say you have an anger problem or struggle with shame – are you stuck?  If you want to start a huge fight among social scientists, bring up this nature versus nurture debate. But while opinions differ, most agree that both our innate nature as well as our environment and upbringing affect us. This emotional wiring, if it gets out of balance, can seriously impact our lives. Research is finding that our environment can actually reshape the way our genes express themselves, meaning we can rewire our brains to some extent. The study of this interplay of genes and environment is known as epigenetics.  Each of us has a unique emotional makeup or temperament, which the psychiatrist Gregory Cohen calls our emotional profile. This is like an emotional fingerprint, unique to each person. It’s the mix and balance of our different emotions – which ones are stronger, how easily they get triggered, and how intense they get. One person may become enraged when they get stuck in a long line at the grocery store, while another person may find it far easier to wait patiently.  Psychologists describe our emotional wiring in terms of four categories. Your threshold is what it takes to trigger an emotion and get it building. The latency to peak is how fast the emotion builds. Magnitude describes how intense the emotion gets. And recovery is how long it takes the emotion to die down. A study on rats found that if the rodents had anxious mothers, their genes were activated in a way that made them grow up to be anxious too. And if they had calmer mothers, the rats’ genes were activated in a way that made them more mellow. So while the rats’ innate genes did play a part, they were directly influenced and activated by their environment.  This can be seen in people who’ve had abusive and traumatic upbringings. They often struggle to lead a well-adjusted life because their adverse childhood environment actually changed the way they developed.  Young people’s minds are more malleable than adult brains, which is why childhood can have such a strong effect on how they turn out. But this doesn’t mean adults can’t change. It just takes more effort and persistence.  To change your brain, you need to change your habits and regulate your emotions. Sonja Lyubomirsky, a happiness researcher, recommends specific steps to help with this shift. They include spending time with others, being intentionally kind, living in the moment, and exercising regularly. Remember, everyone’s different; there’s no “right” emotional profile. The goal is to become  attuned to whether your emotions and responses are in – or out of – balance.  We’ve discovered that genes have a huge influence on people’s personalities.

Humans unconsciously mimic each other and sync emotions because our brains are wired for empathy and cooperation. That means positive or negative emotions can spread through interaction with others (or by hearing them laugh on a laugh track.) It’s called emotional contagion.  A long-term study conducted by Harvard and the University of California, San Antonio, over two decades, found that people who spend time around happy people tend to be happier. That’s not just because they gravitate toward like-minded people; it’s also because of the way we sync our emotions.  Social media studies have found similar results. Facebook secretly manipulated users’ feeds in 2012 to expose them to more positive or negative content. It found that people who were exposed to more positive content wrote more positive posts, and vice versa. If you have the sense that social media is spreading outrage . . . you’re probably right.  Happiness and unhappiness really are contagious. If you find yourself upset or dealing with more negative emotions than usual, check to see whether you’re catching unhappiness from somewhere. We can’t always control the influences in our lives. But being aware of how your interactions are affecting your mood gives you the power to take necessary steps (like changing the way you use social media).  Your mental state can also affect your health. Researchers have found that happier people have fewer biochemical markers associated with the risk of diseases. Another study found that happier people were much more likely not to catch a cold when they were exposed to cold germs.  Don’t catch a case of unhappiness!

Research indicates that people who can control their emotions and use them strategically are – surprise, surprise – more successful in many spheres of life.  The good news is that there are three steps you can take to help you do that: acceptance, reappraisal, and expression.  Let’s look at acceptance first. The idea here is to focus on your response to circumstances rather than on what you can’t control. It plays strongly into the Greek philosophy of stoicism, which emphasizes being immune to circumstances and emotions – and not letting other people’s behavior dictate your well-being.  This doesn’t mean you should passively accept whatever life throws at you. Instead, it shows that you can change your expectations based on what you know to be out of your control. Acceptance can help people be incredibly resilient, even when faced with horrific circumstances.  The second part of the strategy, reappraisal, is learning how to put a spin on something. As we learned earlier, our emotions help us make sense of a situation. They tell us how to react, both unconsciously (which we have less control over) and consciously (which we can control).  If you’re stuck in a traffic jam, you might naturally focus on negative aspects – like the way it’s going to make you late for work. But this can result in a rapid buildup of negative emotions. If you focus on the positive elements instead – My boss will likely understand and may even be caught in the same jam or I’m missing out on a boring meeting – your emotions can follow suit. It’s important, of course, to tell yourself the truth. Reappraisal isn’t about tricking yourself with lies, but about finding the positive in the situation.  And third, express your feelings. You might think that talking or writing about what you’re feeling will make the feelings stronger, but, in fact, the opposite is true. So find a trusted person to talk to – especially one with similar experiences.  A 2010 study of traders working in investment banking found evidence of this. It’s an incredibly stressful industry that can push people to the emotional edge. The study found that traders who tried to suppress their emotions were less successful, while those who thoughtfully identified their emotions – and even relied on them to help make intuitive decisions – were more successful.  Being able to sort out our feelings and correctly understand them is called emotional intelligence. Individuals with emotional intelligence are deeply aware of their emotions. They understand the emotional signals they’re sending to others as well as the emotional signals those people are sending back. There’s a term for this kind of person – charismatic. And it’s another trait that’s been linked to success. Your emotional reactions may be conscious or unconscious.

Sometimes, though, the emotions that helped our ancestors leap away from a cobra or fight off an attack from a rival can get us in trouble today. Constant anxiety can paralyze you and keep you from walking out the door in the morning. And punching an enemy in the face can get you locked up for assault. But that’s not an excuse to ignore our emotions. Instead, it’s a powerful reason to get in touch with them and learn what they’re trying to tell us. None of us will ever be perfect. But with effort and persistence, we can improve our emotional states – and, as a result, our lives.  Did you know we also offer company subscriptions?
