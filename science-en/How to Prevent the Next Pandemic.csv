0,How to Prevent the Next Pandemic,Bill Gates,"How to Prevent the Next Pandemic (2022) is a blueprint for the international pandemic prevention plan the world sorely needs. Learning from the mistakes of the Covid 19 pandemic, Gates lays down a series of steps governments need to take if we’re to protect ourselves and ensure another global health catastrophe of this scale never happens again.","Bill Gates is a business leader, investor, and philanthropist who co-founded the Microsoft corporation in 1975. Today he’s co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, an institution dedicated to improving global health by investing in vaccines, health infrastructure, and sanitation in developing countries. He’s also a big investor in green technology and is the author of the New York Times bestselling book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster."," This Blink has very much focused on the big picture – and that’s because there’s a huge role that big institutions, like governments and our fictional GERM team, will need to play in order to control the spread of disease on a global scale. On the individual level, it may seem like there’s not much you can do to influence the course of a pandemic. But that’s not true. Pandemics are caused by the cumulative actions of many individuals, so there are plenty of ways you can help keep your community safer. For one, you can do your part in following any health and safety guidelines that may be put into place during an emergency – like wearing a mask, social distancing, and getting vaccinated as soon as you’re able to. You can also help by electing leaders who value science and will take advice from experts when the time comes.  But, most of all, you can help to keep health and disease prevention on the agenda by not letting the world forget just how devastating Covid was. Sure, we all can't wait to put Covid behind us, but there’s one thing we simply can’t afford to do: return to being complacent about pandemics. That doesn’t mean we have to live in perpetual fear of another deadly outbreak. It just means we have to understand that another pandemic is possible – and be willing to do what we know it takes to prevent it. Did you know we also offer company subscriptions?
