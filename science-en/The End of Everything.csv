0,The End of Everything,Katie Mack,"How will the universe end? Will it cool down, tear apart, or even collide with a parallel universe? The Blink to The End of Everything (2020) peers into the furthest reaches of time and space, shedding light on the ultimate end of the universe and everything in it. Drawing on the latest cutting-edge research in cosmology and particle physics, the book introduces us to five of the most likely cosmic doomsday scenarios proposed and describes what it would actually be like to experience them.","Dr. Katie Mack is a theoretical astrophysicist exploring a range of questions in cosmology, the study of the universe from beginning to end. She currently holds the position of Hawking Chair in Cosmology and Science Communication at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, where she carries out research on dark matter and the early universe and works to make physics more accessible to the general public. She is the author of the book The End of Everything: (Astrophysically Speaking) and has written for a number of popular publications, such as Scientific American, Slate, Sky & Telescope, Time, and Cosmos magazine. She can be found on Twitter as @AstroKatie."," Every story must have an end. But this story has five of them. At least five potential endings, depending on which astrophysical theory you go with. We’re talking about nothing less than the end of the universe, also known as literally everything that ever existed, exists or will exist. Okay, to be honest, no one actually knows how we’re going to kick the bucket. Science has some guesses, though. The universe might slowly cool down, heat up in a cosmic barbecue, tear apart, get ballooned through by a quantum bubble of death, or, last but not least, spark a new big bang. To give you the cosmological nomenclature, we’re talking about: the Big Crunch, Heat Death, the Big Rip, Vacuum Decay and the Big Bounce.  Welcome to the Blinks to The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking), by astrophysicist Dr. Katie Mack. We’d like to extend a special thank you to Dr. Mack, who very   kindly edited these Blinks for us.  Okay, so we’ll  go through each of the endings one by one. All of these scenarios have one thing in common: there will be an end. This story won’t continue forever. Every story must have an end. But this story has five of them.

All of these scenarios have one thing in common: there will be an end. This story won’t continue forever. Okay, but before we dive into our scientifically viable endings, let’s first talk about the non-astrophysical ends of the world. Because, as human culture attests, there’s certainly been no shortage of speculation throughout the years. For thousands of years, it was religion that painted the picture of our eventual demise. All the major religions of the world today have something to say about the end times yet to come. Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all teach a view of the end that is decisively final. In these religions, the world will undergo a sort of last-minute rebalancing act in which good overcomes evil and the faithful are rewarded for their troubles in the afterlife. But, look instead to the Mayan and Hindu traditions, and you won’t find an epic final event, but rather a vision of the cosmos that rejuvenates itself endlessly. In such cyclical cosmologies, every end of one cycle heralds the beginning of another. But that doesn’t mean they’re indifferent about how this cycle ends. With each cycle of the wheel, there’s hope that things will work out a bit better for us the next time around. Such optimism is usually nowhere to be found in philosophical perspectives on the end of the world. In contrast to religion, philosophy doesn’t really expect the universe to care about us – an idea that is probably best summed up in the concept of nihilism. A nihilist essentially says: Well, if nothing is going to last anyway, why give a damn? Life is completely meaningless!  Although they come to different conclusions, both religious and philosophical worldviews look to how it all ends to decide what meaning to give to the present moment. If we know how it’s going to end, they say, it will inform how we ought to live on the path toward that end. Makes sense, doesn’t it? These days, the philosophical questions about the meaning of life haven’t changed all that much, but the question of the end of the universe has become a firmly scientific one. With particle accelerators and gigantic telescopes, our ability to study the universe has drastically improved, to say the least. And not only that, they’ve also granted us a glimpse into the future. Human beings are nothing if not tenacious. After thousands of years of culture and scientific inquiry, we’re now able, for the first time, to create pretty detailed models for how this great theater we call the universe will finally draw to a close. So let’s start with the first one . . . the Big Crunch. Okay, but before we dive into our scientifically viable endings, let’s first talk about the non-astrophysical ends of the world.

After thousands of years of culture and scientific inquiry, we’re now able, for the first time, to create pretty detailed models for how this great theater we call the universe will finally draw to a close. So let’s start with the first one . . . the Big Crunch. It all started with a bang. Just think, at the very first moment, around 13.8 billion years ago, the entire observable universe was condensed into a point smaller than an atom. And then, for some reason, it suddenly exploded, stretching out in every direction faster than the speed of light. At first, this baby universe was extremely hot and dense; imagine an all-encompassing, cosmic pressure cooker. But, as the universe got bigger, it started to cool down, which allowed particles to form, and effectively laid down the building blocks for the planets, stars, and galaxies we see today. Ever since we discovered that the universe is expanding, the next logical question had to be, What happens if it stops and turns around? Enter the Big Crunch. The Big Crunch scenario is what will happen if everything in the universe were to recollapse to a single point. As you can imagine, it won’t be pretty. This will only happen though if the universe contains enough matter to overcome the initial push of the big bang. In that case, the gravitational pull of all that matter on each other will eventually cause the expansion to slow down, stop, and pull the universe back together again. It’s no different from when you throw a ball straight up in the air; gravity will slow its ascent, stop it, and pull it back to Earth. The only real difference is that the ball won’t end the universe on the way down. So, what would a Big Crunch apocalypse look like? That’s why you’re really here, right? Well, at first, it’ll be hardly noticeable. All we would see is that distant galaxies have stopped moving away from us and are now moving . . . well, toward us. Then, as they start to get closer, there will be the usual tumult of merging galaxies: fresh influxes of interstellar gas will cause new stars to light up the darkness, black holes will swell from the extra matter they consume, and entire solar systems will be flung out of their orbits into the void. As time moves on, it’ll be terrifyingly clear that something far worse is coming. As the universe becomes ever more claustrophobic, the frequency of supernovae will increase, flooding space with radiation. For their part, black holes will shoot out jets of high-energy particles as the matter they consume gets hotter. As all this radiation is condensed into a smaller and smaller space, it’ll eventually reach energies higher even than the final stages of the big bang. That radiation will be so intense it’ll actually ignite the surface of stars. Nuclear explosions will pierce through their atmospheres, ripping them apart, and blasting hot plasma into space. Eventually, the intensity of this radiation will be so high that all matter in the universe is reduced to its component particles. What happens then is anybody’s guess because the densities and temperatures at this late stage are simply beyond what current particle theories can describe. Yikes! So, that’s it. That’s what we have to look forward to if our universe is fated for a big crunch. And, until recently, that’s exactly what astronomers predicted. But, in the 1990s, a team of astronomers made a discovery that shocked pretty much everybody and forced us to rethink the universe’s ultimate demise. It turns out – plot twist – the universe’s rate of expansion isn’t slowing down at all – it’s getting faster. It all started with a bang.

Well, at first, it’ll be hardly noticeable. All we would see is that distant galaxies have stopped moving away from us and are now moving . . . well, toward us. Then, as they start to get closer, there will be the usual tumult of merging galaxies: fresh influxes of interstellar gas will cause new stars to light up the darkness, black holes will swell from the extra matter they consume, and entire solar systems will be flung out of their orbits into the void. As time moves on, it’ll be terrifyingly clear that something far worse is coming. As the universe becomes ever more claustrophobic, the frequency of supernovae will increase, flooding space with radiation. For their part, black holes will shoot out jets of high-energy particles as the matter they consume gets hotter. As all this radiation is condensed into a smaller and smaller space, it’ll eventually reach energies higher even than the final stages of the big bang. That radiation will be so intense it’ll actually ignite the surface of stars. Nuclear explosions will pierce through their atmospheres, ripping them apart, and blasting hot plasma into space. Eventually, the intensity of this radiation will be so high that all matter in the universe is reduced to its component particles. What happens then is anybody’s guess because the densities and temperatures at this late stage are simply beyond what current particle theories can describe. Yikes! So, that’s it. That’s what we have to look forward to if our universe is fated for a big crunch. And, until recently, that’s exactly what astronomers predicted. But, in the 1990s, a team of astronomers made a discovery that shocked pretty much everybody and forced us to rethink the universe’s ultimate demise. It turns out – plot twist – the universe’s rate of expansion isn’t slowing down at all – it’s getting faster. So, the natural alternative to a collapsing universe is one that just keeps on getting bigger and bigger . . . forever. To go back to the analogy of throwing a ball in the air; if a collapsing universe is like a ball that falls back to Earth, an eternally expanding universe is like a ball that was thrown so inhumanly fast, that it actually manages to escape the Earth’s pull entirely and just coasts along forever. You might think a universe that goes on forever sounds pretty nice. For one thing, it means we’re not doomed to roast in an all-encompassing cosmic barbecue. But, like immortality, a universe that goes on forever only sounds appealing until you actually think about it. The reason for this has to do with entropy. Entropy is a measure of how much disorder there is in a system. The higher the entropy, the higher the disorder. For example, jigsaw pieces have higher entropy when they’re dumped in a pile than when they’re organized into a completed puzzle; that’s because while there are countless ways to arrange pieces in a pile, there’s only one way to arrange them in a completed puzzle. The important thing to know right now is that total entropy in a system only ever gets higher over time. That’s a fact so universal, it’s one of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics. And, it makes sense. When left alone, things usually become less ordered as time goes by, not more. Anyone who tries to keep their home tidy should know this. The second law of thermodynamics might be the universe's most infuriating natural law. Okay, so it’s bad for our nerves, but why is this bad for the universe? Because it means every structure in the universe is eventually fated to disintegrate. Because of entropy, the universe is on an inexorable path toward dark, cold, empty nothing.  This is known as Heat Death, a somewhat counterintuitive name for what would be a very cold universe. But the word “heat” here is meant in the technical physics sense, which has nothing to do with warmth, but rather with the level of disorder in a system. With Heat Death, the apocalypse isn’t some momentary cataclysmic event, but more like an agonizingly slow decline of health. This is what it’ll look like: First, we’ll begin to get more isolated. As distant galaxies expand away from us faster than their light can reach us, they’ll disappear from the night sky and become lost to us forever. One by one, the sky will be emptied of light. And, it won’t just be us. Eventually, every galaxy cluster will be completely isolated, surrounded by total darkness. Never again will anything approach to feed them fresh supplies of matter. Eventually, their stars will burn out and fade, and later, even the supermassive black holes at their core will evaporate. In fact, give it enough time, and even particles will disintegrate. Once the universe has achieved the highest possible entropy, there’ll be nothing left. It’ll no longer be possible for any kind of organized structure to develop, or any process of any kind to occur. The hands of time, in all meaningful respects, will stop ticking. Still, at least in this scenario, space gets to continue existing. In the next one, we’ll consider the possibility that an unseen phantom dark energy might literally tear space apart. It’s true what people say, things can always get worse. So, the natural alternative to a collapsing universe is one that just keeps on getting bigger and bigger . . . forever.

In the next one, we’ll consider the possibility that an unseen phantom dark energy might literally tear space apart. It’s true what people say, things can always get worse. For something that apparently exists everywhere in the universe, dark energy is pretty tricky to pin down. In fact, the term ‘dark energy’ is really just a shorthand cosmologists use to refer to any kind of cosmic phenomenon that could help explain why the universe is accelerating in its expansion. Given that space is expanding uniformly in every direction, it’s assumed that dark energy probably exists uniformly throughout the universe, intertwined with the nature of space itself.  But, aside from that, we really know very little about this cosmic enigma. Hence the word “dark.” So, it could be that dark energy is a perfectly safe property of empty space and its only effect is to stretch out the space in between things. But, alternatively, it could be something that builds up within objects, which means it could end up violently tearing the universe apart – a scenario appropriately named the Big Rip.  Think of it like a bitter divorce – only, involving everything in the universe. The first thing to say their goodbyes will be the great galaxy clusters. Huge groups of swirling galaxies, hundreds of thousands strong, will experience their orbits getting wider and wider. Eventually, the outer galaxies will drift away entirely, like guests leaving a party at the end of the night. Then, the galaxies themselves will start to dissipate. Stars on their outer limits will be swept away into the growing cosmic void. Our night sky will dim as the great Milky Way disperses. By this time, stellar systems will start to feel the strain. Planets will spiral out of their orbits, and be lost to the darkness. The Earth is also destined to decouple from the sun and drift out into space. But this newfound independence won’t last long. Soon, any structure still remaining will be struggling against the stress of space expanding within it. The Earth’s tectonic motions will also be thrown into chaos by the changing gravitational forces acting upon it. In the final hours, these pressures will become too much and the Earth will explode. Before long, even the bonds holding atoms and molecules together won’t be able to hold out. Molecules will crack open, followed shortly by atomic nuclei. In the final moment, space itself will be torn apart. Unfortunately, we might never be sure whether our universe is headed for a Big Rip. That's because the difference between a universe fated to expand forever and one fated to be ripped apart amounts to an endlessly small variation in the nature of dark energy. Still, what we can say is that, if it were to happen, it would be so far in the distant future of the cosmos – we’re talking hundreds of billions of years – that most structures in the universe will have decayed by that point anyway. So, there won’t be much left to cry over. All the scenarios we’ve covered so far have had this small comfort of being so far in the cosmic future, that on human scales, they’re hardly worth worrying about. The next scenario, however, is decidedly more imminent than the others. This one could happen at any moment. So for the next one, sit tight.

As much as physicists love exploring the mechanics behind theoretical doomsday scenarios, it’s usually pretty hard to get hold of observational data to back them up. After all, if they were to happen, we wouldn’t be around to take notes. So, for the most part, doomsday theories are treated more like curious possibilities than serious physics. Such was the case with Vacuum Decay: the idea that a quantum bubble of death could balloon through the universe, destroying everything in its path. Wait, what? Okay, let’s back up a bit. Until recently, there wasn’t really any evidence to support such an idea, so it wasn’t taken all that seriously. But, back in 2012, when the Large Hadron Collider at CERN confirmed the existence of the Higgs field for the first time, it suddenly became a dangerously real possibility. Oops.  The good news about the discovery was that it completely aligned with what was expected by the standard model of particle physics. The bad news was that it hinted that many of the fundamental laws of nature that we take for granted – you know, the ones that make life possible, to begin with – aren’t entirely stable.  Just think, right now we live in a perfectly balanced universe where the masses and charges of particles are set just right so as to enable them to come together and form molecules, and objects, and perform all the chemical processes needed for life. Well, it turns out, far from being timeless, fundamental laws of the universe, these constants are actually just properties of the Higgs field at its current value. And there’s nothing to say this value can’t change – it all depends on the shape of the field’s potential, which determines what values it can take. And based on what we have recently learned about that potential, our whole beautiful cosmos appears to be balancing on the edge of a knife.  Clearly, the Higgs field can remain at a safe value for a very long time, long enough for stars to form, and life to develop. But it’s speculated that if a powerful enough disturbance were to occur, this could potentially knock the Higgs field into a lower potential. The good news? From everything we know, that kind of power just doesn’t exist in the universe. The bad news? Quantum mechanics says the field can change anyway, randomly, at any moment. And, if that were to happen, you can kiss your sweet universe goodbye.  All it would take is a tiny, infinitesimal portion of space to fall to a lower point on the Higgs potential, either through a major disturbance or a random quantum jiggle. The space around it, preferring the stability of this lower point, will revert to it. In this way, the bubble of altered space will spread like an avalanche, cascading in every direction at the speed of light.  Anything that gets in the bubble’s way will first be incinerated by a wall of intense energy that encases the bubble like a shell. This will immediately be followed by a process that can only be described as complete and utter dissociation. Inside the bubble, the space would be so radically altered that the bonds that ordinarily hold particles together simply don’t operate. So, any matter that makes it inside will simply be obliterated.  As terrifying as this sounds, you really shouldn’t let vacuum decay keep you up at night. For one thing, it’ll be a completely painless death. But, if that doesn’t console you, take comfort in the fact that it’s incredibly unlikely to happen, at least for several trillions of years. Seriously, you’d be better off wearing a seat belt or checking the batteries in your smoke alarm than planning for this potential doomsday.

Well, it turns out, far from being timeless, fundamental laws of the universe, these constants are actually just properties of the Higgs field at its current value. And there’s nothing to say this value can’t change – it all depends on the shape of the field’s potential, which determines what values it can take. And based on what we have recently learned about that potential, our whole beautiful cosmos appears to be balancing on the edge of a knife.  Clearly, the Higgs field can remain at a safe value for a very long time, long enough for stars to form, and life to develop. But it’s speculated that if a powerful enough disturbance were to occur, this could potentially knock the Higgs field into a lower potential. The good news? From everything we know, that kind of power just doesn’t exist in the universe. The bad news? Quantum mechanics says the field can change anyway, randomly, at any moment. And, if that were to happen, you can kiss your sweet universe goodbye.  All it would take is a tiny, infinitesimal portion of space to fall to a lower point on the Higgs potential, either through a major disturbance or a random quantum jiggle. The space around it, preferring the stability of this lower point, will revert to it. In this way, the bubble of altered space will spread like an avalanche, cascading in every direction at the speed of light.  Anything that gets in the bubble’s way will first be incinerated by a wall of intense energy that encases the bubble like a shell. This will immediately be followed by a process that can only be described as complete and utter dissociation. Inside the bubble, the space would be so radically altered that the bonds that ordinarily hold particles together simply don’t operate. So, any matter that makes it inside will simply be obliterated.  As terrifying as this sounds, you really shouldn’t let vacuum decay keep you up at night. For one thing, it’ll be a completely painless death. But, if that doesn’t console you, take comfort in the fact that it’s incredibly unlikely to happen, at least for several trillions of years. Seriously, you’d be better off wearing a seat belt or checking the batteries in your smoke alarm than planning for this potential doomsday. As much as physicists love exploring the mechanics behind theoretical doomsday scenarios, it’s usually pretty hard to get hold of observational data to back them up. After all, if they were to happen, we wouldn’t be around to take notes. So, for the most part, doomsday theories are treated more like curious possibilities than serious physics. Such was the case with Vacuum Decay: the idea that a quantum bubble of death could balloon through the universe, destroying everything in its path. Wait, what? Okay, let’s back up a bit. Until recently, there wasn’t really any evidence to support such an idea, so it wasn’t taken all that seriously. But, back in 2012, when the Large Hadron Collider at CERN confirmed the existence of the Higgs field for the first time, it suddenly became a dangerously real possibility.

This scenario considers the possibility of extra dimensions and parallel universes, and, we have to admit – it’s wilder than a lot of tinfoil-hat theories. But stay with us. Here’s the deal: We as humans can only perceive reality in three dimensions, thanks to our limited brains. But just because we can’t perceive something, doesn’t mean it’s not there. And when we say “something,“ what we mean is “extra dimensions.” And there are some hints that point to at least one extra dimension. For one, there's the mysterious weakness of gravity. If you haven’t noticed, gravity is a suspiciously weak force. It’s so weak that every time you take a sip from your coffee, you’re overcoming the gravity of the entire Earth. Some brainy physicists have proposed a rather straightforward explanation why: namely, that the gravity is leaking . . . into another dimension.  If there really is another dimension out there, then perhaps our universe is just one plane of an even bigger spacetime. Who knows, maybe that extra dimension is home to other universes just like ours. And, if that were true, maybe they’d be capable of influencing ours with their gravity. Maybe the universes could even collide. Enter the ekpyrotic cosmos. According to the original version of this theory, the cosmos we live in is the product of a collision between our universe and another one right next door. The intensity of the collision is what caused the inferno of the big bang that set our cosmos on the path of expansion that we see today. According to this theory, the collision repelled the two universes apart, like balls bouncing off each other. This caused the universes to drift across higher dimensional space, each getting cooler and expanding. That’s where we are now. But since they exert gravity on each other, the universes will eventually pull back together, causing another bounce. If this theory is correct, and another bounce occurs, we and everything we know will be annihilated in the process.  Ekpyrotic models of the universe are cyclical in nature. Each fiery end of one cycle constitutes the beginning of another. Creation and destruction occur simultaneously over and over again. But, how likely is it, really, that we’ll be struck by another universe like an interdimensional flyswatter? Well, the notion of parallel universes is still firmly in the realm of speculation. In fact, newer formulations of the ekpyrotic model don’t require extra dimensions at all. In their various forms, cyclical models of the universe have a certain allure. For one thing, they offer a potential answer to the question of what happened before the big bang. They also present the tantalizing prospect that some information, such as gravitational waves, might survive from one cycle to the next, and we may one day be able to detect this. Right now, all the data we have seems compatible with the standard big bang inflation picture of the universe. But, there are still problems with this model that need to be solved. Nor have we shown that other universes don’t exist. So, right now, the ekpyrotic model is still a viable alternative.

Now, to wrap things up, let’s ask the most important question: If the universe is going to end anyway, is there still a point in taking out the trash? Well, yes. First of all, we can be pretty sure that none of these cosmic annihilation scenarios are happening any time soon. Even according to the most pessimistic estimates, it’ll be tens of billions of years before a Big Crunch could pull our universe back together, and at least 100 billion years before a Big Rip could tear it apart. Even the most likely scenario – the Heat Death – would be so slow that we can hardly fathom how far into the cosmic future it would happen. Okay, you might say, it’s not ending soon, but it’s still ending. Ultimately, nothing we do in life could possibly survive in the long term. How can we find any meaning in a meaningless universe? Or even just on the way to the trash can? Well, perhaps the situation isn’t as bleak as all that. As they say, it’s the journey that really counts, right? Why should we get so hung up about the last page of the story? Who cares how it ends; let’s just be thankful we were ever here, to begin with. Sure, the cosmos won’t last forever. But, in the meantime, the cosmos – our home – is a truly miraculous, awe-inspiring place, and it’s well worth our time to get to know it – while we still have the chance.
