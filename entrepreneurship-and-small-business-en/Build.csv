0,Build,Tony Fadell,Build (2022) is a self-styled “mentor in a box” –⁠ an encyclopedia of business advice about everything from getting a job and managing a team to telling a story around your product and being a successful CEO. A mentor is an absolute must-have for anyone who aspires to start and run a business –⁠ but not everyone has one available right away. That’s what Build is for.,"Tony Fadell is best known for cocreating the iPod and iPhone, founding Nest, and creating the Nest Learning Thermostat. He is now the Principal at Future Shape, a venture capital firm that invests in and mentors startups with world-changing potential. Before any of his major successes, Fadell started his career at one of the countless Silicon Valley startups that believed it could conquer the world but instead crashed and burned."," You’ve just listened to our Blink to Build, by Tony Fadell.  One final takeaway from this is that: Building a career, a product, or a business requires you to draw from a deep well of motivation and stick-to-itiveness. If you’re young and just starting out, the best thing you can do is find a job where you can learn everything possible about the thing you’re passionate about and throw yourself into your work. If you’re a bit more advanced and have, say, a management role, your key goal should be creating the conditions for your team to produce your desired outcome. And if you’re a CEO, your job is to care –⁠ to push your company to take risks, strive for excellence, and ensure that everyone knows that what they’re doing matters. And here’s one more bit of actionable advice:  Write your press release before making your product. Press releases are meant to capture people’s attention. To do that, you have to cut to the chase and highlight the features that make your product stand out. Write your press release when you first start developing your product. Then, when you’re almost finished – weeks, months, or years later – reread the press release you originally wrote. Does your product, in its current state, roughly align with that? If so, the product is probably ready to release now. No more waffling, waiting, and pushing deadlines back to see if other features can still be added! Rate RequestThank you for listening!
