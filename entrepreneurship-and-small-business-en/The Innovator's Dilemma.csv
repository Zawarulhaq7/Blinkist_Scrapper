0,The Innovator's Dilemma,Clayton Christensen,The Innovator’s Dilemma explains why so many well-established companies fail dismally when faced with the emerging markets they create. This Blink focuses on one of the book’s central themes: disruptive innovation.,Clayton M. Christensen (1952–2020) was a professor at Harvard Business School and one of the foremost management researchers in the world. He wrote numerous books and more than a hundred articles. The Economist named his book The Innovator’s Dilemma as one of the six most important business books ever.," Stuck in the innovator’s dilemma: that’s a scary place to be. Is there a way out? In Gillette’s case, it’s too early to tell – we’ll have to wait to see if its own home delivery subscription service will be enough to fend off competitors. But Christensen’s book isn’t really about finding a way out. Its biggest lesson is that managers have to avoid the trap in the first place. As Paul Steinberg, the chief technology officer for Motorola Solutions, put it, Christensen’s message is that companies must learn to incubate new ideas or perish. Steinberg adds that that message “scared the crap” out of him when he first read The Innovator’s Dilemma. He wasn’t alone. Christensen’s greatest legacy may well be that he taught a generation of business leaders that fear is often the best guide on the path to success. Did you know we also offer company subscriptions?
