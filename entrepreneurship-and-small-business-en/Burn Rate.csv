0,Burn Rate,Andy Dunn,"Burn Rate (2022) is the no-holds-barred story of Andy Dunn, cofounder of menswear startup Bonobos, and his struggles with bipolar disorder. Long in denial about his diagnosis, Dunn eventually faced up to the condition – but not before it had nearly cost him everything.","Andy Dunn has an MBA from Stanford, where he cofounded Bonobos, a direct-to-consumer menswear brand, with Brian Spaly in 2007. He served as Bonobos’ CEO before its acquisition in 2017. Now an angel investor who runs the venture capital firm Red Swan, he has backed more than 80 startups in total."," You’ve just finished our Blink to Burn Rate, by Andy Dunn.  The most important takeaway from all this is: For 16 years, Andy Dunn largely acted like he didn’t have bipolar disorder at all – despite frequent bouts of hypomania and depression. During that time, he put together the successful menswear startup Bonobos and met Manuela, the love of his life. But his condition nearly cost him everything. Since experiencing several serious episodes of mania, Andy has committed to taking care of his mental health. A better understanding of his illness, alongside therapy and medication, continue to help him manage his condition day by day. And here’s some more actionable advice:  Call mental illness what it is – illness. It’s too easy to think of mental health as something different from physical health. And sure, it manifests in very different ways. But, ultimately, it’s the same thing. When Manuela’s mom forgave Andy, she likened his mental illness to diabetes – a condition that can be treated and lived with. That’s something to bear in mind. Saying someone “is bipolar” rather than “has bipolar disorder” is like saying someone “is cancer” rather than “has cancer.” Instead of stigmatizing people with mental health conditions, try to think of their condition as any other kind of illness.
