0,No Red Lights,Alan Patricof,"No Red Lights (2022) is part-autobiography, part-guidebook to assembling the core fundamentals of your career. Geared primarily toward aspiring venture capitalists but helpful for anyone interested in business, it’s packed with instructive lessons and useful advice. Simultaneously, it is a glimpse into the life of man who’s spent 50 years learning –⁠ and living –⁠ the tricks of the trade.","Alan Patricof is an American venture capitalist who founded the firms Greycroft and Apax Partners. Throughout his long career, he has been involved in the growth and development of such major companies as Venmo, Bumble, HuffPost, America Online, Office Depot, and Apple Computer. Currently, he is working on developing his latest company, Primetime Partners, which is focused on investing in technology, products, and services related to aging. "," In 1961, the first stretches of the Berlin Wall were laid down to separate the two halves of the city, East and West. Not long after, US President Kennedy responded by activating 156,000 army reserves. One of the units called up was the one Alan belonged to –⁠ the 411 Quartermaster Corps. 
 Alan’s life and career were suddenly flipped upside down. In just 30 days, he had to complete all the preparations to leave and then report to Fort Lee, Virginia. 
 Alan was fortunate in the fact that his boss at the time assured him he’d still have his job when he came back, and that he’d even pay Alan his salary while he was gone. Despite that, the sudden activation of the reserves was deeply disruptive to Alan and everyone else in his unit. But Alan rose to the challenge and adapted to it, as he always aims to do. 
 Undoubtedly, one of the biggest challenges that Alan faced in life was watching the slow decline of his wife, Susan, who fell ill in 2008. 
 The issue began with Susan experiencing fairly minor memory issues. It didn’t seem like such a big deal at first, but eventually, she and Alan decided she needed to see a doctor. 
 Susan was eventually diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Alan watched as her illness progressed over ten-plus years, taking a deep emotional toll on him as Susan’s mind and body slowly slipped away from her. She ultimately died peacefully among her family in January 2021. 
 Although the experience was extremely difficult, witnessing his wife’s decline in addition to his own experiences with aging inspired Alan. He considered how aging could potentially apply to a business venture. Despite the fact that the aging sector is the fastest-growing segment of the population, the market for products, services, and technologies designed for aging individuals is still relatively untapped. 
 The opportunity seemed too good to pass up, so Alan thought: Why not create a third business focused on investing in older entrepreneurs and business ideas related to aging? 
 And that’s exactly what he did, opening up his latest company, Primetime Partners, on July 1, 2020. Most people may be inclined to say that at Alan’s age, it’s time to throw in the towel and retire. But Alan disagrees. He’s still got plenty of energy, so why stop now? That, essentially, has been the overarching motto of his life: just keep going; there are no red lights.
