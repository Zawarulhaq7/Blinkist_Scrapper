0,Good to Great (New Version),Jim Collins,"Good to Great (2011) presents the findings of a five-year study by Jim Collins and his research team. They identified public companies that had achieved enduring success after years of mediocre performance and isolated the factors that differentiated those companies from their lackluster competitors. These factors have been distilled into key concepts regarding leadership, culture, and strategic management.","Jim Collins is an American author, lecturer, and consultant. He has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and is a frequent contributor to Fortune, BusinessWeek, and Harvard Business Review. "," The key takeaway here is that:  Companies that go from good to great do so by creating a simple hedgehog concept, hiring the right people (especially at the leadership level), and pursuing their strategy with a culture of rigor and self-discipline. A few pointed questions will help you form your hedgehog concept: What can you be the best in the world at? What can you be passionate about? And what key economic indicator should you concentrate on? Did you know we also offer company subscriptions?
