0,Choose Possibility,Sukhinder Singh Cassidy,"Choose Possibility (2021) provides a roadmap to building the smarts and courage it takes to become a master of risk. Drawn from tech leader Sukhinder Singh Cassidy’s winding path through business, itdebunks the myth that risk is all about singular, life-altering choices. Instead, itshows how risk-taking is a process, a practice and a skill that can unlock your professional potential.","Sukhinder Singh Cassidy is a leading tech CEO and entrepreneur with decades of experience in founding, building, and guiding companies such as Google, Stubhub, Amazon, and more. She’s the founder and current chair of theBoardlist, a marketplace that connects businesses to a growing and diverse pool of talent."," Humans suffer from a fundamental misconception of risk. Too often, we think only of the moves that promise to define our lives, and when we think of life-altering choices, risk becomes forbidding, foreboding, even terrifying. We fear that one bad choice could bankrupt us or destroy our reputations. But, true make-or-break moments are rare, and if you look closer, you see that they’re often made up of many smaller risks, moments that pose questions. Should you, for example, speak up in that meeting, or perhaps return that recruiter’s call? Risk is an evolving state of uncertainty and promise. These blinks will show you how to embrace it with intelligence and generosity. And help you to see that when you choose possibility, you can make your own opportunities.

In these blinks, you’ll learn In the spring of 1993, Singh Cassidy was getting ready to launch her career. She was in her last semester of college and was eager to start the career she thought she wanted. Her goal was to become an investment banker, or perhaps a management consultant. She applied to big firms and dreamed of success: fat paychecks, power suits, and CEOs to her left and right. But spring and summer passed, fall came, and to Singh Cassidy’s increasing despair, not a single job offer materialized. Stuck at her parent’s home in Ontario, Canada, she watched as her former classmates set off to pursue their careers. She’d only just graduated but feared she’d already failed. The key message here is: Free yourself from the hero’s journey and pursue multiple options at once. Our culture thrives on heroic myths, stories where one person risks everything to vanquish a foe, prove her worthiness, and achieve her dreams. When we recall these stories, we often distill the hero’s journey into an unalterable path, forgetting that along the way, our hero faced many possibilities. The same can be said for our careers. When you imagine that a single choice defines you, you lose sight of the numerous other options out there. You catastrophize your setbacks and let your fear of failure gain the upper hand. You may even quit. But if, instead, you take on multiple, small risks, you’ll find you can build momentum and generate unforeseen opportunities. Take the example of Ashvin Kumar, who founded an e-commerce start-up in 2008. Instead of pursuing a single platform, his company launched almost 20 apps within 18 months. Each app took little in terms of capital, yet having so many meant lots of room for feedback. It was a numbers game. By expanding his options, Kumar reduced his risk and maximized his opportunity. Eventually, a live auction app, called Tophatter, took off and found millions of users. Back in 1993, a similar approach broke Singh Cassidy out of her post-college doldrums. She took a low-level job at a regional bank while pursuing several low-stakes risks: she applied to med school, passed Canada’s foreign service exam, and took a crack at the Law School Admissions Test. Most importantly, she accepted a train ticket to New York City. In the next blink, we’ll see how putting herself in the proximity of Wall Street unlocked new possibilities.

Most importantly, she accepted a train ticket to New York City. In the next blink, we’ll see how putting herself in the proximity of Wall Street unlocked new possibilities. It was one evening during her post-college year at her parents’ house when Singh Cassidy got her big break: a rejection letter in the mail. She’d gotten many. But this particular one was from the megabank Merrill Lynch, and it politely closed with an invitation to visit the firm in New York City. Singh Cassidy took the invitation as a bit of pro forma kindness. A balm for the sting of rejection. But her father read it differently. As a young man, he’d relocated from Africa to Canada and started his own medical practice in a rural town. He was no stranger to overlooked opportunities and recognized this moment for what it was. He bought his daughter a train ticket to New York on the spot. The key message here is: Fortune favors the physically present. Buying that train ticket turned out to be a stroke of marvelous fortune for Singh Cassidy. At Merrill Lynch, she went on an informal tour, which gave way to a brief interview, which in turn led to an invitation to a full-day tryout for a position as an analyst. A month later, she aced the tryout and got the job. By going from rural Ontario to Wall Street, she’d learned that she had to be near her dreams in order to seize the hidden opportunities that would lead to them. But the lesson of proximity and opportunity didn’t end there. After a year in New York, Singh Cassidy won a spot at Merrill Lynch in London, England. There she joined British Sky Broadcasting in what amounted to an apprenticeship under Sky’s founders. All the while, she continued to build her professional network. And it was through these connections that she learned of something historic happening in California. In 1996, Singh Cassidy bought a plane ticket to San Francisco and was on the ground when the tech boom took off. Each risk revealed a new opportunity, which in turn opened the next. It wasn’t a path she could have planned. But, this kind of unpredictable journey may be the fastest. A study by LinkedIn looking at the careers of hundreds of thousands of people found that high-level consultants and CEOs rise faster when they follow winding paths. That isn’t to say that you should ditch planning your career and throw caution to the wind. But as we’re about to find out, embracing risk means being honest about your fears.

Singh Cassidy’s sister Nicky was in trouble. She was working late into the night, every night, trying to save her once-thriving optometry business. Her practice was in a shopping mall, and foot traffic was low. Local competitors were cropping up, and online retailers had begun undercutting her prices. Nicky knew she had to make a change, but she was afraid of what she’d lose: money invested in equipment, a community of patients, and a roster of devoted employees. The key message here is: To get momentum and take the leap, you must face your fear of loss. Fear of loss is powerful, but when it comes to risk and opportunity, there’s another fear at play: the fear of missing out, or FOMO. As long as our fear of loss outweighs our FOMO, we won’t act. But we can adjust the balance of fears, by looking hard at what it is we’re scared of. The first step is to name your worries. Are they financial? If so, exactly how much do you stand to lose? If you fear professional or personal loss, untangle any legitimate concerns from the desire to protect your ego. Second, imagine how things will seem over time; in three months, three years, or ten, will your problems loom as large? Let’s say they do come to pass, what next? Ask yourself whether the damage is truly irreversible. More often than not, big decisions can be undone. Finally, draw up a contingency plan to ward against lasting damage. Consider the story of 58-year-old Google engineer, Alan Eustace, who jumped to Earth from the stratosphere in 2014. The otherwise unassuming computer scientist ran over 250 tests on his jumpsuit in the three years leading up to his record-breaking leap. He planned for every potential mishap until eventually, his FOMO outweighed his fear. Knowing that he’d soberly stared down his anxiety, he went up in the sky and safely jumped the 25 miles back down to Earth. Eustace challenged his fear of loss and came out on top. For Nicky, the tactic also worked. She went through the steps to examine her worries and followed her sister’s advice, pursuing multiple low-stakes options to generate new opportunities. When a job with potential came along, she was ready and able to take the plunge. She lost her optometry practice, but regained her life and opened a new chapter in her career.

But we can adjust the balance of fears, by looking hard at what it is we’re scared of. The first step is to name your worries. Are they financial? If so, exactly how much do you stand to lose? If you fear professional or personal loss, untangle any legitimate concerns from the desire to protect your ego. Second, imagine how things will seem over time; in three months, three years, or ten, will your problems loom as large? Let’s say they do come to pass, what next? Ask yourself whether the damage is truly irreversible. More often than not, big decisions can be undone. Finally, draw up a contingency plan to ward against lasting damage. Consider the story of 58-year-old Google engineer, Alan Eustace, who jumped to Earth from the stratosphere in 2014. The otherwise unassuming computer scientist ran over 250 tests on his jumpsuit in the three years leading up to his record-breaking leap. He planned for every potential mishap until eventually, his FOMO outweighed his fear. Knowing that he’d soberly stared down his anxiety, he went up in the sky and safely jumped the 25 miles back down to Earth. Eustace challenged his fear of loss and came out on top. For Nicky, the tactic also worked. She went through the steps to examine her worries and followed her sister’s advice, pursuing multiple low-stakes options to generate new opportunities. When a job with potential came along, she was ready and able to take the plunge. She lost her optometry practice, but regained her life and opened a new chapter in her career. When Singh Cassidy left Merrill Lynch and went to work under British Sky Broadcasting’s founders, Sam Chisholm and David Chance, she’d found men with the entrepreneurial passion to bring a dream to fruition. That passion was contagious, so when looking for her next career move, Singh Cassidy decided that she wanted to get in on the ground floor of an innovative entertainment company. In 1997, she accepted a management position at OpenTV, a California-based interactive television startup. But, on her second day, her boss pulled her to one side with a word of advice: tone it down. She was, he said, simply too intense for her new workplace. Her time at OpenTV went downhill from there. The key message here is: When evaluating whether to make a career move, tip the scales in favor of people. Pursuing a job in the field you find most interesting is a natural goal, but unless you work entirely alone, your colleagues will play a big role in your ultimate success or failure. A dream job in an abusive workplace can quickly become a nightmare. On the other hand, inspiring coworkers can turn an otherwise dreary position into a thrilling challenge. In weighing her move to OpenTV, Singh Cassidy had failed to account for who she’d be working with. The passion and drive that had served her at Merrill Lynch and Sky made her, as they say in HR, a bad people fit at OpenTV. So, Singh Cassidy got busy generating new possibilities and one day she visited an information management start-up called Junglee. Information management seemed a bit dull, but she saw immediately that the people at Junglee were her professional tribe: they were hungry, smart, straightforward, and passionate. Singh Cassidy joined up with Junglee, threw herself into supporting her new colleagues, and soon forged relationships that would play a positive role in her career for decades to come. When you find your professional tribe, look for the teachers who take a special interest in developing the talent around them. Apprentice yourself and learn by osmosis. And hang onto those colleagues you can turn to for a constructive, honest opinion. You’ll need each other’s reliable advice over the course of a career. Finally, cultivate friends that understand your ambitions and stoke your enthusiasm. Together, you can keep each other fired up for the long haul.

At Junglee, Singh Cassidy worked as a manager before moving to build her own start-up, Yodlee, that sold for a large profit to Amazon. She subsequently launched her own tech company, which also sold for big money, and then joined Google, getting Google Maps off the ground and becoming one of its highest-ranking executives. As relentlessly driven as she was throughout this meteoric rise, Singh Cassidy credits much of her good fortune to a historic tailwind: the tech boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The key message here is: Know yourself and know what’s out of your control. When thinking about success, it’s tempting to credit just hard work, talent, and smarts. But, success is about a lot more than your skills. The contributions of others and the prevailing forces of history are just as crucial in getting you to the top. And failure isn’t all down to your individual abilities or lack of them either. Overestimating your control of events can cause you to take failure as a sign of inner weakness. Not only is this train of thought unhelpful and masochistic, it’s inaccurate. Just as tailwinds can help lift a project to success, large adverse forces – or headwinds – can doom a project. But tough as it is to fight these headwinds, they can provide unique opportunities for professional growth. Take the case of Jane Fraser, Citigroup’s first female CEO. Fraser took the helm against two powerful headwinds: the near collapse of Citigroup’s Latin American banking operations and the subprime mortgage crisis. Yet she held the financial institution together and earned a reputation for flexibility and tremendous resilience. If you’re fighting headwinds, take comfort in the knowledge that you’re building rare, battle-tested skills. Of course, some headwinds drain your energy to no good end. Struggling against a bad people fit, for example, won’t recommend you to future employers. To know whether you’re in a bad-people-fit situation, the first person you must know is yourself. Examine your passions, talents, and values and ask whether they have a place at your company. Get an outside view from those mentors and constructive colleagues we mentioned in the last blink. Be honest about your weaknesses and strive for improvement. If you’ve done the work of self-appraisal and the headwinds aren’t worth it, then it’s probably time to move on, choose possibility, and take that next risk.

Let’s take a minute to step back and review what we’ve learned so far. We’ve learned to value proximity and being in reach of our goals, and the people that come along with them. We’ve also learned to value self-knowledge, as well as the circumstances beyond our control. Most importantly, we’ve learned that risk isn’t a single, life-altering choice, but an ongoing practice. But then again, some risks – such as a mid-life career change or a move across the country – are undeniably large. The stakes are high. So, what should you do in these situations? The key message here is: The tools you’ve honed on smaller risks can be combined to unpack bigger ones.  You can demystify big risks by breaking down the potential costs and opportunities involved. In other words, deconstruct and rate both your fear of loss and your fear of missing out. The first thing to do is list out and prioritize each element. An opportunity can be measured by its potential to fulfill your ambitions; its fit with your personal strengths, weaknesses, and values; the headwinds and tailwinds acting on it; and finally, the other people involved. By rating each of these factors, you can score the opportunity overall. Next, turn to the downsides. Rate the potential financial harm, injury to your reputation or ego, or any personal loss that might result. Now ask yourself whether this choice is a two-way door: Is it reversible? Do you have a recovery plan? A rating for each of these factors can add up to a risk score to compare against your opportunity score. Still, even after methodically naming and weighing the upsides and downsides of an opportunity, your gut might still tug at you. Don’t ignore it. Humans take in a lot of information that’s never fully articulated in our conscious minds. The misgivings of your gut could be a warning from your subconscious. Of course, your gut also gets things wrong. To mitigate the harm of rashly following your instincts against the benefit of observing your intuition, listen to your gut, but interrogate it. By repeatedly testing your feelings against data, you create a solution that satisfies both your gut and your mind. Let’s take a minute to step back and review what we’ve learned so far.

When Singh Cassidy took on her first CEO gig, it was a move that she made with some trepidation. The job was at Polyvore, a fashion-focused e-commerce platform, and she knew that she’d be working alongside Polyvore’s founder. In other words, she was being asked to run the company while the man who’d created and run it to that point was right beside her. She set up regular coffee dates with the founder in order to build a rapport of honesty and respect. But sure enough, a schism opened between them. Their visions for Polyvore simply didn’t match, and when the crisis came to a head, Singh Cassidy found herself out of a job. At the time, she counted the loss as her single greatest professional failure, but after a while, silver linings emerged. The key message here is: Risk and reward have a nonlinear and often unpredictable relationship. Despite losing the job, Singh Cassidy had gone in with her eyes open. She’d negotiated a stake in the company, and under her leadership, Polyvore grew rapidly; after she left, Polyvore sold to Yahoo, earning her a handsome payday. What’s more, her strong – albeit short – performance as CEO gained attention from other companies, and the experience gave her the impetus and know-how to start her own online shopping platform, Joyus. We often assume that a big risk will equal a big reward. But, results are often widespread. A lost job might result in new professional connections, knowledge gained, or the inside scoop on an investment opportunity, and these results may appear at unpredictable times. This means that as we pursue multiple options, the offshoots of our decisions grow over time. We’ll have cycles of ups and downs as the overall trajectory of our careers trend upward. Some risks, though, do bring definitive results. In five years, for example, Singh Cassidy would know whether Joyus was truly viable. And waiting for the big result can be valuable time too, providing plenty of opportunity to maximize your professional growth. First, remember to put your passion into everything your new project requires, even the aspects that seem dull. Embrace the nitty gritty and the big picture. Learn the headwinds and the tailwinds. Dig for the truth behind persistent problems, share that truth, and seek new solutions. By working hard and smart in all the unpredictable ways the project calls for, you’ll not only gain a more diverse set of skills, but you’ll also generate new opportunities as the big picture takes shape.

The job was at Polyvore, a fashion-focused e-commerce platform, and she knew that she’d be working alongside Polyvore’s founder. In other words, she was being asked to run the company while the man who’d created and run it to that point was right beside her. She set up regular coffee dates with the founder in order to build a rapport of honesty and respect. But sure enough, a schism opened between them. Their visions for Polyvore simply didn’t match, and when the crisis came to a head, Singh Cassidy found herself out of a job. At the time, she counted the loss as her single greatest professional failure, but after a while, silver linings emerged. The key message here is: Risk and reward have a nonlinear and often unpredictable relationship. Despite losing the job, Singh Cassidy had gone in with her eyes open. She’d negotiated a stake in the company, and under her leadership, Polyvore grew rapidly; after she left, Polyvore sold to Yahoo, earning her a handsome payday. What’s more, her strong – albeit short – performance as CEO gained attention from other companies, and the experience gave her the impetus and know-how to start her own online shopping platform, Joyus. We often assume that a big risk will equal a big reward. But, results are often widespread. A lost job might result in new professional connections, knowledge gained, or the inside scoop on an investment opportunity, and these results may appear at unpredictable times. This means that as we pursue multiple options, the offshoots of our decisions grow over time. We’ll have cycles of ups and downs as the overall trajectory of our careers trend upward. Some risks, though, do bring definitive results. In five years, for example, Singh Cassidy would know whether Joyus was truly viable. And waiting for the big result can be valuable time too, providing plenty of opportunity to maximize your professional growth. First, remember to put your passion into everything your new project requires, even the aspects that seem dull. Embrace the nitty gritty and the big picture. Learn the headwinds and the tailwinds. Dig for the truth behind persistent problems, share that truth, and seek new solutions.

Singh Cassidy’s fashion commerce start-up Joyus had a wild ride. She assembled a first-rate team, attracted millions of dollars from investors and patented an e-commerce video player. The videos were the start-up’s principal feature. Produced in-house, they were sleek and beautiful, and, unlike other shopping videos, they were interactive and allowed users to buy the products. The videos were also costly to make. Despite doubling revenues every year, Joyus couldn’t balance those revenues against the cost of production. After six years, Joyus sold to another company. Unlike OpenTV and Polyvore where the disappointments came quickly, the letdown of Joyus came after years of work, years that were full of small successes. But Joyus offered an even greater learning opportunity. The key message here is: Learn from failure and, when the time comes, move on in a way that will create more opportunity. From Joyus, Singh Cassidy learned to spot the trouble of balancing two or more large goals. Joyus not only needed to produce high-value video content, it also hoped to rapidly expand its customer base while effectively pricing the fashion items within the video to those new customers. These competing challenges substantially complicated the company’s ability to become reliably profitable. In your own professional life, any number of factors can contribute to failure. Perhaps you mistake being busy for having an impact. Or fail to listen to feedback and address your weaknesses. Occasionally, a desire to succeed may even lead you to shy away from difficult, underlying problems. Singh Cassidy had to overcome this tendency when, as the head of Google’s international operations, she and her team had to negotiate the markets, politics, and regulations of myriad different countries endlessly.  If you’re struggling with a deteriorating situation, use the framework we laid out earlier to continually reassess your fit with the challenge before you. If your impact and, perhaps more importantly, your learning flatlines, it may be time to look for a new challenge. But before you resign and walk out the door, here are a few tips for getting the most out of your departure. First, don’t quit before you quit. Give your team your maximum effort right through to your last day. Tee up your colleagues for success. Share what you’ve learned and don’t leave a mess. But also, don’t linger and collect a paycheck once your work is done. Remember, the people you’ve worked with will have a continuing influence on your opportunities.

In 2015, Singh Cassidy opened her Rolodex and started reaching out to other women who, like her, were tech leaders. She had a project in mind. The industry was roiling with debate over gender and equity. Singh Cassidy knew that women were thriving in tech in spite of the bias and harassment they faced, but she’d long noticed that one realm of power remained closed to them: the boardroom. When pressed, male CEOs often responded that there simply weren’t enough qualified women to fill board positions. Singh Cassidy meant to show them they were wrong, and in the process, create new cycles of growth and opportunity for women in tech. The key message here is: Power comes from choice and generosity. That year, Singh Cassidy founded theBoardlist, a talent marketplace that helps tech leaders promote and connect with women for leadership positions. It began with 600 names and now boasts over 16,000 qualified members. By creating opportunities for others, Singh Cassidy discovered the most meaningful project of her career. She saw that the truly powerful let their power flow to those around them. It’s a lesson she learned first from her father, a man who, even after decades in the highest realms of business, she still rates as the most powerful person she’s ever known. Singh Cassidy’s father emigrated from across the world to rural Canada. Everywhere he went, he chose possibility and gave power to others. In some instances, the acts were large, such as when he gathered local doctors to create a walk-in clinic for their town in Ontario. Other times, the acts were small but no less powerful. A man named Bobby once approached Singh Cassidy and told her that when he was a young man, he came to her father in a state of profound doubt. He told her father that he, too, wanted to become a doctor, but that he worried he didn’t have what it takes. Singh Cassidy’s father took Bobby’s hands and turned them over. He looked Bobby in the eye and told him that these were the hands of a surgeon. That moment, Bobby says, gave him the courage he needed to follow his dream. Power starts small. You can lend a word of encouragement, write a letter of recommendation, and let the spotlight shine on others. The power you exert by choosing possibility and then sharing it is renewable. And no one can take it from you because it comes from within. In 2015, Singh Cassidy opened her Rolodex and started reaching out to other women who, like her, were tech leaders.

You can lend a word of encouragement, write a letter of recommendation, and let the spotlight shine on others. The power you exert by choosing possibility and then sharing it is renewable. And no one can take it from you because it comes from within. The key message in these blinks is this: Risk is a state of uncertainty and possibility. It’s everywhere. But when we embrace it with humility, intelligence, and generosity, we can create ongoing cycles of growth. And if there’s one thing to remember, it’s not to deny your fears. Instead find them, explore them, and answer them. Do that and you’ll open up a whole world of opportunity. Actionable advice: Make a habit of taking small risks. Follow Eleanor Roosevelt’s advice and “Do one thing every day that scares you.” With each win, you gain momentum, and, with each loss, you learn. Either way, you grow. You’ll uncover new opportunities and become stronger and braver. What’s more, little acts of bravery accumulate over time. So, when the occasion arises to make an audacious leap, you’ll likely find that you’ve already made several smaller passes that’ll inform and strengthen your efforts.
