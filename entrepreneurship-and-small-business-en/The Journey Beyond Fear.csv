During his 40-year career in Silicon Valley, Hagel has identified three practical tools that anyone can benefit from. Here, he explains exactly how to use them, so you can make the most of exciting new opportunities in your professional and personal life.","John Hagel III is a business strategist based in Silicon Valley, and the founder of the company Beyond Our Edge. He was formerly a partner at Deloitte, and he also worked with McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group. Hagel has written several books on business, including The Power of the Pull."," You’ll get so much more out of life if you can overcome your fear. To do this, find motivation in your personal narrative, and identify what really excites you. Then find ways to collaborate with others, ideally through learning platforms. That way, whatever your calling in life,  you can achieve your true potential. And here’s some more actionable advice:  Use cellular organization.  When people are working and learning together, small groups are often the most effective. Hagel recommends creating “cells” of around 3 to 15 people who meet regularly. It’s easier for small groups of people to form trust-based relationships, supporting each other and learning from each other. You can see this kind of structure everywhere – in churches, political movements, and even Alcoholics Anonymous. If you want to make more of an impact, try adopting cellular organization in your workplace or community. Did you know we also offer company subscriptions?
