I am resourceful, resilient, and experimental. I want to make things better, and I know how. In life, I am guided by a clear vision of my higher order goals and personal philosophy.” Make this manifesto your own to unleash your inner maverick. In doing so, you’ll find self-fulfillment, improve your organization, and maybe even change the world.  One step you could take right now is to ask a coworker, “How should I change to bring out the best in you?” When the other person makes some suggestions, you can reply, “In order for me to change, it would help me if you changed your own behavior in this way.” And so on. It’s a fantastic ice-breaker that relies on trust – and also helps create it. In this way, you can start growing a network of people who support you.
