0,Make No Small Plans,"Elliott Bisnow, Brett Leve, Jeff Rosenthal and Jeremy Schwartz","Make No Small Plans (2022) is the inside story of how a group of young entrepreneurs created one of the world’s most exciting platforms for global events and conferences – the Summit Series. This isn’t just a chance for them to recount their company’s history, though. Packed with actionable takeaways and business wisdom, this is a book designed to inspire readers on their own entrepreneurial journeys.","Elliott Bisnow, Jeff Rosenthal, Jeremy Schwartz, and Brett Leve are the cofounders and co-owners of Summit Group, an organization dedicated to fostering a global community of business and thought leaders. They’re also active investors through the Summit Action Fund, an investment vehicle that has backed up-and-coming start-ups like Uber and Warby Parker at critical moments in their development."," So, Summit may have started with one great groundbreaking idea . . . but how can a company stand the test of time and stay innovative? Summit’s answer is that you foster a culture in which no idea goes unspoken. Let’s break that down. 
 Ideas are egalitarian. Interns can have great ideas and CEOs can have terrible ideas. It can go the other way too, of course. Sometimes relative inexperience and experience do matter. Point is, a great idea can come from anywhere, and the status of the person proposing it isn’t a reliable indicator of its worth. 
 So that’s the first marker of a culture that’s open to ideas: everyone gets a fair hearing. The second marker is that there’s an emphasis on generating lots of ideas. Put differently, it’s not just that anyone can put forward an idea – it’s that there’s an expectation that everyone will. 
 That’s because quantity makes quality. It’s only by getting it all out there that you get to the good stuff. If an idea isn’t right, you move on. No harm, no foul. You don’t have to commit to a bad idea just because you’ve given it a hearing, but the more bad ideas you hear the more likely you are to find the good ones. 
 On one level, hiring an entire cruise ship for more than a million dollars was a crazy idea. But it’s what put Summit over the top. That’s where that culture makes a difference. When you’re willing to engage with crazy-sounding ideas, you often find out that they’re actually workable. 
 Take another wild idea – getting Jeff Bezos to appear at a Summit event without blowing the company’s entire annual budget on speaking fees. It just doesn’t sound doable – this is one of the world’s richest and most in-demand men, after all. Okay, sure, but let’s give the idea a fair hearing. 
 What is a speaking fee anyway? Well, it’s a benefit – a remuneration for someone’s time and energy. But does it have to take the form of money? The more they thought about it, the less sure Summit’s founders were that it did. Elliott, for example, remembered a deal he’d struck with a limousine service years earlier. The company wanted to place ads in his newsletter, but couldn’t afford to. So they came to a different arrangement: they got the ads and Elliott got to use their limousines to drive to meetings. 
 There’d been similar deals with bands who’d performed at Summit events, too. But what can you offer a man who has it all? The answer was a platform. 
 This was 2016. Bezos had become a household name, but people didn’t really know his story. Who was he? Where had he come from? What were his values? So that’s what Summit offered him: a chance to tell that story to a live audience of 2,500 as well as the millions of people who’d later watch a recording of the interview. That, to him, was a unique benefit that was far, far more valuable than a speaker’s fee. 
 The moral of the story? Make big plans and give crazy ideas a hearing. You never know – they might just work out. So, Summit may have started with one great groundbreaking idea . . . but how can a company stand the test of time and stay innovative? Summit’s answer is that you foster a culture in which no idea goes unspoken. Let’s break that down.
