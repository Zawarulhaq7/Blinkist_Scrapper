0,Zero to One (New Version),Peter Thiel with Blake Masters,"Zero to One (2014) offers advice to start-up founders. It shows how to establish a monopoly by creating proprietary technology, a strong brand, scalable products, and by using network effects.","Peter Thiel cofounded PayPal and is one of the most prominent venture capitalists in the world. He was the first outsider to invest in Facebook and has a net worth of over seven billion dollars. Blake Masters, a venture capitalist, served as the president of the Thiel Foundation until 2022."," If you want to become a successful entrepreneur, one strategy you can pursue is trying to build a business that obtains a monopoly. To do that, first, you have to form a vision: your goal is to go from zero to one, meaning that you create a whole new category instead of just mimicking what everybody else does. When you’ve found an unusual idea to base your start-up on, don’t go too broad too quickly. Find a small niche where you can do something way better than any of your competitors. Once you’ve established a monopoly there, you can expand to other markets later. But remember: you have to be ready to challenge established conventions. Success is for the bold. And not for the copycats. Did you know we also offer company subscriptions?
