0,Earth for All,"Sandrine Dixson-Decleve, Owen Gaffney, Jayati Ghosh, Jorgen Randers, Johan Rockstrom and Per Espen Stoknes","Earth for All (2022) is more than a book – it’s a survival guide. After centuries of industrialization, population growth, and rising inequality, our planet is now at a tipping point. We are already learning to live with pandemics, war, wildfires, and more. This guide offers timely, practical solutions for the urgent problems facing humankind.","The Earth4All collective brings together leading economists, scientists, and ecological advocates to secure a flourishing future for humanity. In Earth for All, authors Sandrine Dixson-Declève, Owen Gaffney, Jayati Ghosh, Jørgen Randers, Johan Rockström, and Per Espen Stoknes challenge us to rethink our relationship with capitalism and industry, with an objective of securing the sweeping systemic change necessary to save the planet."," Our planet is on the brink. Ecological collapse and widespread social unrest loom on the horizon. The pain points are clear – extreme inequality, reliance on fossil fuels, destructive agricultural technologies, and unsustainable diets have brought us to this point. So where do we go from here? Earth for All explains two likely scenarios. The first is the Too Little Too Late scenario, where we continue on our current path. Industrialization and growth are prioritized above the planet’s health and as a result, inequality grows even more extreme. Global warming far outstrips the 2°C goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Large communities face megadroughts, famine, and extreme weather events. Low-income countries are disproportionately affected by these adverse events. The social tensions arriving from this inequality fuel conflict and mass migration. The second is the Giant Leap scenario. It entails a rapid, large-scale systemic overhaul of the global economy. A daunting prospect, yet one that will redress key inequalities and insecurities around poverty, population growth, food, and energy . . . and just might save the planet in the process.

In India, a family lose their farm. Recent rice harvests have been ravaged by drought and the profits from their meager harvests have been eroded by multinational agro-companies undercutting the sale price for rice crops. Drought-resistant rice seeds are available, but the family simply can’t afford to purchase them. Meanwhile, in California, a billionaire boards his private jet for a 15-minute flight between two cities. There’s something wrong with this picture. Gross wealth inequality is one of the most pressing problems facing our planet. The richest billion people in the world consume 72 percent of the planet’s resources. The poorest 1.2 billion, most of whom reside in low-income countries, consume 1 percent. Moreover, high-income countries cause the most carbon emissions, yet low-income countries shoulder a disproportionate share of the negative effects of these emissions. Outsourcing production to low-income countries has seen wealthy corporations offload polluting manufacturing processes to the developing world. Until low-income countries prosper economically, they will continue to struggle to implement the green technologies necessary to combat climate change that is, for them, a particularly urgent problem. Low-income countries, and indeed low-income communities within high-income countries, need a pathway out of poverty. The problem? They can’t simply emulate high-income countries which became prosperous through ecologically ruinous industrialization. Instead, the global economic system needs a rethink. Currently, the IMF regulates a global debt structure that sees countries borrowing and lending to each other with substantial interest. Many low-income countries are held back by massive debt obligations. Repayments – funds that could otherwise be reinvested into social and ecological initiatives – are estimated to cost some African countries 4 percent of GDP a year. This has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic which saw debt in low-income countries soar to $86 billion. A comprehensive global debt relief package would immediately improve the economies of low-income countries. Debt weakens local currency and negatively impacts liquidity – lifting debts would strengthen currencies and free up cash to invest in social initiatives and local industry. A global Green New Deal – one that legislates against corporations investing in polluting industries in the developing world – would incentivize all economies to switch to green technologies. A carbon tax levied squarely at carbon producers – crucially, one that distinguishes between the country or corporation responsible for emissions and the country where emissions are recorded – should reduce the global carbon footprint. If intellectual property laws which protect the patents on new green technologies were relaxed, poorer countries would be able to swiftly implement ecological, sustainable farming and manufacturing processes.

Population growth has often been seen as a ticking time bomb threatening to destroy the planet – anxiety about the growing number of people competing for Earth’s depleting resources is nothing new. In the past 100 years the world’s population has doubled . . . twice over. And if population growth continues at its current rate, the world population will balloon to 11 billion people – a number that will place the planet under considerable strain. But the workable, compassionate solution to this situation isn’t quite as simple as slowing population growth. Instead, it lies in empowering some of the world’s most vulnerable demographics: women and the elderly. Population growth isn’t spread consistently across the globe. In some high-income parts of the world, the birth rate is less than two children per woman. Women in low-income countries are likely to have more children – in West Africa, for example, the birth rate is six or seven children per woman. The reason? Higher-income women are more likely to be educated, have careers, and be informed about family planning options. These are all factors that lead to both a lower birth rate and a higher income per person. If women in low-income countries can access quality education, they’ll see increased social mobility and economic opportunity. These changes will, in turn, impact their family planning. But low-income countries, burdened with debt, have little revenue to inject into education. Overhauling debt structures would enable low-income countries to improve the quality and accessibility of their educational offerings. While education improves economic opportunity, an even more immediate intervention to lift vulnerable demographics out of poverty is the introduction of universal basic income. A pilot program providing UBI to Indian women – with no stipulations about how it should be spent – showed improved nutritional and educational outcomes for their families and increased economic growth overall. It’s high time that initiatives like universal basic income were framed as investments rather than expenditures. The finding that UBI can actually drive economic growth is widespread. And it presents an innovative solution to another demographic issue: as we approach 2050, our population will grow increasingly elderly. As more and more of Earth’s inhabitants age out of work and move into the health problems posed by old age, how can we support them? Through a substantial UBI. In fact, the authors propose an enhanced version of universal basic income – a universal basic dividend. The private sector pays fees for extracting and consuming Earth’s resources into a fund. Dividends from this fund are distributed equally among all the planet’s citizens.

Dividends from this fund are distributed equally among all the planet’s citizens. Let’s compare and contrast a young woman from a low-income country and a young man from a high-income one. The young woman from a low-income country has no access to varied, nutritious food even though the region where she lives is largely agricultural – the food grown there is exported to other countries. She lives with chronic undernutrition – stunted growth, wasted muscles, and a weakened immune system. She is one of the 9 percent of people worldwide who live with extreme food insecurity. The young man from a high-income country has access to plenty of food, much of it flown in from low-income countries, but most affordable options are highly processed with added fats and sugars. He lives with obesity. He’s at increased risk of diabetes and heart disease. He may be one of the 8 percent of people worldwide whose deaths will be linked to obesity each year. Despite the dramatic difference in their diets and circumstances, both these people are victims of the inequitable and unsustainable ways in which we farm and distribute food. In its current state, agriculture is destroying the planet. When it comes to carbon emissions, the industry is one of the biggest culprits. It’s the world’s largest driver for loss of biodiversity, deforestation, pollution, and overfishing. By 2050, to meet population demand, the planet will need to produce 50 percent more food while battling the increasingly frequent extreme weather events that will reduce the amount of arable land. The current model sees monocultural crop production concentrated in a few regions then exported globally – grain for example is grown primarily in Russia, Ukraine, Argentina, and Australia. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine destabilized two major grain producers, sent grain prices soaring, and highlighted the precarity of the current system. So, what’s to be done? After all, there’s no escaping the fact that we still need to eat.  The focus needs to shift to sustainable intensification – in other words, doing more with less.  How?  Land expansion needs to stop. Farms need to curb carbon. And food needs to be produced efficiently. The key to pulling it all off might be under our noses – or more accurately, under our feet. Soil is a natural carbon store but as that carbon is exposed to air it becomes carbon dioxide and enters the atmosphere. Conventional agricultural practices have seen soil lose between 50 and 70 percent of its carbon stock. Rotating crops – using the same land to grow different crops – rather than monocropping, improves soil’s stability and capacity to store carbon. Growing diverse crops also helps prevent pests and diseases that attack one kind of crop from becoming endemic. This enables farmers to use less polluting pesticides. Cover crops, planted to cover the soil rather than for harvest, can also maintain the structure and integrity of the soil. New technologies allow seeds to be drilled into soil, which limits the exposure of stored carbon to oxygen. These regenerative farming techniques will allow more food to be produced for local consumption, in greater quantities, using less land. This will be expensive. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, an overhaul of the political system that drives global economic practice must happen for the planet to make this necessary shift to regenerative agriculture. Changing agricultural practices won’t be enough alone. Those of us in high-income countries need to radically rethink our diets. Crucially, we must transition to a planetary health diet – one that’s not strictly vegan or vegetarian, but drastically reduces the consumption of unsustainable animal and dairy products. Innovations in plant-based and lab-grown animal products mean we won’t have to say goodbye to cheeseburgers completely.

Despite the dramatic difference in their diets and circumstances, both these people are victims of the inequitable and unsustainable ways in which we farm and distribute food. In its current state, agriculture is destroying the planet. When it comes to carbon emissions, the industry is one of the biggest culprits. It’s the world’s largest driver for loss of biodiversity, deforestation, pollution, and overfishing. By 2050, to meet population demand, the planet will need to produce 50 percent more food while battling the increasingly frequent extreme weather events that will reduce the amount of arable land. The current model sees monocultural crop production concentrated in a few regions then exported globally – grain for example is grown primarily in Russia, Ukraine, Argentina, and Australia. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine destabilized two major grain producers, sent grain prices soaring, and highlighted the precarity of the current system. So, what’s to be done? After all, there’s no escaping the fact that we still need to eat.  The focus needs to shift to sustainable intensification – in other words, doing more with less.  How?  Land expansion needs to stop. Farms need to curb carbon. And food needs to be produced efficiently. The key to pulling it all off might be under our noses – or more accurately, under our feet. Soil is a natural carbon store but as that carbon is exposed to air it becomes carbon dioxide and enters the atmosphere. Conventional agricultural practices have seen soil lose between 50 and 70 percent of its carbon stock. Rotating crops – using the same land to grow different crops – rather than monocropping, improves soil’s stability and capacity to store carbon. Growing diverse crops also helps prevent pests and diseases that attack one kind of crop from becoming endemic. This enables farmers to use less polluting pesticides. Cover crops, planted to cover the soil rather than for harvest, can also maintain the structure and integrity of the soil. New technologies allow seeds to be drilled into soil, which limits the exposure of stored carbon to oxygen. These regenerative farming techniques will allow more food to be produced for local consumption, in greater quantities, using less land. This will be expensive. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, an overhaul of the political system that drives global economic practice must happen for the planet to make this necessary shift to regenerative agriculture. Changing agricultural practices won’t be enough alone. Those of us in high-income countries need to radically rethink our diets. Crucially, we must transition to a planetary health diet – one that’s not strictly vegan or vegetarian, but drastically reduces the consumption of unsustainable animal and dairy products. Innovations in plant-based and lab-grown animal products mean we won’t have to say goodbye to cheeseburgers completely. Let’s compare and contrast a young woman from a low-income country and a young man from a high-income one. The young woman from a low-income country has no access to varied, nutritious food even though the region where she lives is largely agricultural – the food grown there is exported to other countries. She lives with chronic undernutrition – stunted growth, wasted muscles, and a weakened immune system. She is one of the 9 percent of people worldwide who live with extreme food insecurity.

The 2015 Paris Agreement set out a blueprint for how the world could face climate change together. One of its most important takeaways? The need to mitigate the effects of climate change by keeping warming levels under 2°C. This means essentially halving carbon emissions every decade from 2020 on. And yet most signatories to the agreement still haven’t significantly reduced their fossil-fuel dependency. Why? Changing our relationship with fossil fuels will mean restructuring the global economy: fossil fuels are entrenched in the industrial-capitalist system; the fossil-fuel lobby is powerful and influential. But we can live without fossil fuels. Do you need coal or oil? Or their byproducts, like concrete, steel, and petrol? Of course, you don’t. You might, on the other hand, need some of the functions they facilitate in your life. They house you, keep you warm, enable you to travel from place to place, help you do your job, and connect with your friends and family. Electricity and renewable energy can keep us warm, mobile, and connected just as well as fossil fuels can. Here’s how we make the transition: We need to become efficient. Not just with what energy sources we use, but, fundamentally, how we use them. It’s a more efficient use of energy if fewer cars are able to transport more people. So, we need to introduce greater systemic efficiencies around transportation – not just having more electric cars on the road, but innovating rideshare options that work, improving existing public transport, and redesigning networks to allow for greater pedestrian and cyclist mobility. And that’s just transport. There are more efficiencies to be identified and implemented across the board. We need to go electric. Energy derived from electrons, not carbon molecules, won’t warm the planet. American environmentalist Bill McKibben puts it very simply: “don’t build anything new that connects to a flame.” Of course, shifting from existing fossil-fuel-powered infrastructure will prove more challenging – but cleaner, greener fuels like green hydrogen and ammonia can help ease the transition. Finally, we need to accept the inevitable. Green power is already here. Increasingly renewable energy is a more cost effective source of new power than fossil fuels. Soon, renewables will be outperforming fossil fuels on cost at every level of the market. Many parts of the world could meet their total electricity needs through solar and wind power – only the infrastructure, for example, adequate solar paneling, is lacking. These new technologies have the potential not just to replace the current fossil-fuel-powered system but far improve it. We’re talking about an abundant supply of power, so plentiful that it will be able to power complex carbon capture systems – and with enough excess to purify and upcycle its own waste products. In terms of energy, humankind is living in the past. With a shift to electricity, the future looks far brighter.

In terms of energy, humankind is living in the past. With a shift to electricity, the future looks far brighter. Earth is at a crisis point. But a crisis isn’t inevitable. A radical restructuring of the global economy, trade system, and resource industry will ensure a prosperous future for humankind and secure improved environmental outcomes for the planet we live on. Sure, the planet’s prognosis may seem bleak. But radical change is possible: social movements like Greta Thunberg’s Fridays for Future are sweeping the globe; the green power sector is poised to disrupt fossil-fuel reliance; and select countries from Finland to China are restructuring their economies to address inequality. We’ll need an extraordinary turnaround to secure our future, but we’ve already made a start. Did you know we also offer company subscriptions?
