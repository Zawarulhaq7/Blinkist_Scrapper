In these blinks, you’ll also learn Here’s a basic fact: not all sweaters are alike. On the one hand, there’s the generic sweatshirt you can pick up just about anywhere. It’s basic, cheap, and functional. It’s the kind of thing you buy because you’ve forgotten to pack a sweater for your holiday. Who made it is pretty much irrelevant. Then there’s the sweatshirt you buy because you want exactly this model by this brand. It’s not just that these sweaters cost more, although they usually do – it’s that there’s more to them than the fabric. They stand for something. They fit your idea of yourself and express something about who you are. The key message in this blink is: The most successful brands don’t sell products – they sell lifestyles. Author Daymond John first made his name in the fashion industry by making clothing that allowed its wearers to do just this. But before we get to that, let’s take a closer look at the different kinds of clothing out there. The first type is represented by that generic sweatshirt. This category is unbranded and low-cost. Think of the basic T-shirts and pants you find in large supermarkets all over the world. Those supermarkets also stock a second category. These clothes cost a little more and are branded, albeit with the no-frills logo of the house label. Think about Costco’s Kirkland brand. You don’t buy jeans or socks because of this label, but it’s there all the same, setting them apart from their cheaper counterparts. If you always buy one brand of sneaker because it has better grip or padding, by contrast, you’re buying products from the third category. In this segment of the market, choices are driven by trust. When you buy from one brand, you know what you’re getting. The American clothing label Under Armour started out in this category. Initially known for its sports T-shirts, which wicked away perspiration more effectively than competitors’ shirts, it gradually expanded into leisurewear. At this point, Under Armour was selling more than products. Wearing the label’s clothes wasn’t just about achieving a specific outcome – it was a lifestyle. The key to this transition? Well, Under Armour practiced what it preached. It really did make the best sports shirts on the market and that built credibility. Eventually, people could use the brand’s sporty image to tell a story about who they were and what they stood for. As we’ll see in the next blink, this insight isn’t just about selling clothes – it’s also key to personal branding. Here’s a basic fact: not all sweaters are alike.

But he had an instinct for marketing. His stunts, which included a jump over a cage of rattlesnakes, turned heads. Soon he had a label – he was that guy. Word spread and folks began remembering his name. It wasn’t a great name, though, so when a cop gave him a ticket for dangerous driving and jokingly called him “Evel Knievel,” he owned it. It was perfect for posters and told audiences what to expect from his rodeos. This was now a lifestyle brand. Always dressed in the same glitzy red, white, and blue motocross suits, Knievel became synonymous with adventure and daredevilry. When kids jumped off roofs, their parents told them not to be such Evel Knievels. His name, in other words, stood for something. The key message in this blink is: The strongest personal brands are instantly recognizable and stand for a specific value. Successful people all have one thing in common: their names are tied to unique traits, values, and accomplishments. Take a couple of historical examples. Abe Lincoln was honest; Muhammad Ali floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee; Aretha Franklin was the “Queen of Soul.” A strong personal brand tells the world what you’re about and what others can expect from you. And that can give you traction when you’re looking to influence people. So how do you build that winning reputation? Well, as we learned in the last blink, you have to practice what you preach. The first step, though, is defining your message and putting it into words. Who do you want to be? Find five or six adjectives to answer that question and try them out for size. If you’re all about kindness, how can you carry yourself in a way that communicates that? Walking the walk isn’t enough, however – you also have to talk your brand up. If your start-up has a charitable mission, for example, you need to promote that mission. To do this, you’ll need to find the right channels. Myspace was great for that back in 2005, but it’s unlikely to help you spread the word in 2020. Finally, you’ll want to make a splash. Think back to Evel Knievel. Of course, you don’t need to jump over rattlesnake-filled cages, but the idea is the same: to build your brand, you need to turn heads.

Of course, you don’t need to jump over rattlesnake-filled cages, but the idea is the same: to build your brand, you need to turn heads. FUBU, the name of John’s label, stands for “For Us, By Us.” Founded in the early nineties, it had a single mission: putting the clothes worn by New York’s hip-hop artists and fans on the fashion map. Spreading the word back then wasn’t easy – these were the pre-internet days, after all. Sure, there was some attention from the press. They were a young company run by black entrepreneurs rooted in the neighborhoods in which hip-hop was blossoming. But a few interviews here and there weren’t enough. Another way to get a brand’s name out there was to rely on influencers. This was before Instagram, of course, but influencers back then played a similar role in the fashion world as they do today. But instead of photographing themselves dressed in freebies, they wore them to New York’s trendiest nightclubs. It was a tried and true approach, but FUBU realized they could do things differently. The key message in this blink is: You don’t have to win over the big names to open doors. The typical influencer was young, slim, and used to attention. Lavished with free clothes, they had the pick of the city’s hottest labels. Even if you managed to get them to wear your clothes, they rarely donned them more than once. Just as he was starting to think about recruiting influencers, John noticed something interesting. FUBU customers who bought larger sizes like 4X, 5X, and 6X tended to wear them into the ground. The thing is, it was hard to find shirts in these sizes that people liked as much as the ones FUBU was putting out. So who were these six-foot-something, 300-pound customers? Well, lots of them were the kind of guys who worked security outside nightclubs. John put two and two together. These bouncers were already part of the city’s fashion scene, but promoters tended to treat them as part of the furniture. Why not show them some love and give them the freebies? It was a clever move. The bouncers appreciated the attention, and FUBU now had an XXL-sized logo prominently displayed outside every fashionable nightspot in New York. The move also opened other doors. One of the part-time bouncers John worked with, a man called Beast, was also head of security for Ralph McDaniels, an influential producer in the city’s hip-hop scene. It was Beast who helped John set up a meeting with McDaniels, who in turn agreed to feature FUBU on Video Music Box – a TV show watched by just about everyone in FUBU’s target demographic!

Just as he was starting to think about recruiting influencers, John noticed something interesting. FUBU customers who bought larger sizes like 4X, 5X, and 6X tended to wear them into the ground. The thing is, it was hard to find shirts in these sizes that people liked as much as the ones FUBU was putting out. So who were these six-foot-something, 300-pound customers? Well, lots of them were the kind of guys who worked security outside nightclubs. John put two and two together. These bouncers were already part of the city’s fashion scene, but promoters tended to treat them as part of the furniture. Why not show them some love and give them the freebies? It was a clever move. The bouncers appreciated the attention, and FUBU now had an XXL-sized logo prominently displayed outside every fashionable nightspot in New York. The move also opened other doors. One of the part-time bouncers John worked with, a man called Beast, was also head of security for Ralph McDaniels, an influential producer in the city’s hip-hop scene. It was Beast who helped John set up a meeting with McDaniels, who in turn agreed to feature FUBU on Video Music Box – a TV show watched by just about everyone in FUBU’s target demographic! FUBU, the name of John’s label, stands for “For Us, By Us.” Founded in the early nineties, it had a single mission: putting the clothes worn by New York’s hip-hop artists and fans on the fashion map. Spreading the word back then wasn’t easy – these were the pre-internet days, after all. Sure, there was some attention from the press. They were a young company run by black entrepreneurs rooted in the neighborhoods in which hip-hop was blossoming. But a few interviews here and there weren’t enough. Another way to get a brand’s name out there was to rely on influencers. This was before Instagram, of course, but influencers back then played a similar role in the fashion world as they do today. But instead of photographing themselves dressed in freebies, they wore them to New York’s trendiest nightclubs. It was a tried and true approach, but FUBU realized they could do things differently.

If you want to pass an exam, you review. If you want your first meeting with a partner’s parents to go well, you ask questions, get the lay of the land, and figure out which subjects to avoid. It’s the same in business. If you want to win an investor over, negotiate a deal, or land a job, you need to bone up on the people sitting on the other side of the table. Preparation, in other words, brings home the bacon. Pretty obvious, right? Well, sure, but it’s the kind of obvious-sounding idea that’s easily forgotten. Take it from a recent CareerBuilder survey, which found that only 64 percent of candidates bother to research a company before applying for a job. Then, there’s the author’s own experience as an investor. The key message in this blink is: Do your homework, and you’ll boost your chances of success. Lots of people love watching Shark Tank, an American TV show in which entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to a panel of five seasoned investors. One of the main draws? Watching these investors rip apart a poorly conceived business plan. As entertaining as these segments are, it’s not really the point of the show. Investors like John, who’s been a “shark” for eleven seasons now, want to hear about brilliant new ideas and get in on the ground floor. Solid pitches are rare, though. Whether it’s laziness or arrogance, most contestants simply wing it. That’s what made Randy Goldberg and David Heath stand out. Together, they founded Bombas, a sock maker with a charitable streak. For every pair of socks it sells, Bombas gives another pair to homeless shelters. John loved the idea from the get-go, but first, he wanted to hear if it worked. Randy and David were prepared to show him that it did. After founding Bombas, they’d sought out an old industry insider. From him, they’d learned just about everything there is to know about making socks. Before appearing on Shark Tank, they watched every single episode of the show and prepared answers to every kind of question asked by a shark in the show’s history. That impressed John, who offered a $200,000 investment in return for a 5 percent stake in Bombas. Today, the company is thriving, and that turned out to be a great call for John. So what’s the lesson here? Simple: the work you put in will always pay you back. If you want to pass an exam, you review.

So what’s the lesson here? Simple: the work you put in will always pay you back. You know the clichés. Business is a dog-eat-dog world, and nice guys finish last. Whatever your hustle, you’re better off keeping your head down and looking out for yourself because no one else will. Right? There’s a grain of truth in this. Business is tough, and you are surrounded by people looking to make their own powershifts. But there’s more to it than that. Think of driving. The reason it’s a bad idea to text when you’re behind the wheel is that it blinds you to what’s going on around you. It’s the same when you’re looking to get ahead. When you’re only concentrating on your own thing, you often end up failing to spot dangers. The key message in this blink is: If you want to thrive, you have to work with others. Companies like FUBU typically ship their clothes to shops in boxes that contain each item in a variety of sizes. Not all shops are alike, though. A large outlet with thousands of customers can sell a popular line of clothing in every size. A small mom-and-pop operation with only a few dozen customers, by contrast, will struggle to replicate that. Depending on the community they serve, the larger sizes might sell well while the smaller sizes remain on the shelves, or vice versa. When that happens, shops ask brands like FUBU to break the box. This means opening up their standardized boxes, removing the in-demand sizes, and delivering these to the shop. Brands hate doing this, however. It’s a logistical headache, and it means they have to figure out how to sell what’s left in the opened boxes. When FUBU faced this problem, it was in a good spot. It was making millions, and John figured they could spare themselves this hassle. If people wanted to buy FUBU’s clothes, they could always head to a larger retailer. What he hadn’t thought through, though, was how these shops would respond to FUBU’s decision. Stuck with stock they couldn’t sell, they started offering fire sales on FUBU merchandise. That’s bad news for a hot brand. As soon as your product ends up on the discount rack, people ask what’s wrong with it. Before long, your hard-won reputation is under threat, and customers start looking to rival companies. It was an invaluable lesson. John’s conclusion? Go ahead and make a good deal, but don’t let yourself get so big-headed you put others at a disadvantage – it may come back to bite you. You know the clichés.

A contestant enters the set and walks over to the investors before launching into her pitch. On air, it looks like she begins speaking immediately. In the studio, though, it’s a little different. The camera crew first film the walk before resetting their equipment for the pitch. This usually takes a couple of minutes. During that time, both the investors and the contestant are supposed to remain silent. For the sharks, this is one of the key moments of the show. Why is that? Well, it’s during this interval that they get to size up the person in front of them. The key message in this blink is: It’s not just your mouth that does the talking – your body also speaks. Some contestants fidget constantly while they wait, underscoring their lack of confidence. Others strike a power pose and stare the sharks down, a move that’s designed to signal assuredness but ends up revealing arrogance. A wry smile, on the other hand, acknowledges the awkwardness and defuses tension. These impressions matter a great deal. Take it from Albert Mehrabian, a psychologist at UCLA and a leading expert on nonverbal communication. According to his research, words account for just 7 percent of what we communicate. Tone, on the other hand, makes up 38 percent while facial expressions and body language determine 55 percent. Inc. magazine, meanwhile, observed 2,000 business negotiations, concluding that not a single deal was made after meetings in which one or both parties folded their arms. The good thing is, you have control over your body language. Take a couple of pointers John has picked up over the years to improve yours. First off: eye contact. You know you’re supposed to look at the person you’re talking to, but what about addressing a group? Lots of people go wrong here, subconsciously locking eyes with the most important person in the room – a move that’s guaranteed to alienate everyone else. The solution? Make sure you’re taking a moment to look at everyone present while speaking. Then there are those all-important facial expressions. The key here is self-awareness. One way of getting a handle on what your face is saying is to record yourself reading from two Twitter feeds. Choose the account of someone who really gets under your skin and the timeline of someone you admire. Watch each recording to notice those subtle and none-too-subtle differences and see if you can hide your true feelings at the second attempt. And there you have it – tips and tricks that will help you win influence and make your powershifts! Every Shark Tank episode starts the same way.

Lots of people go wrong here, subconsciously locking eyes with the most important person in the room – a move that’s guaranteed to alienate everyone else. The solution? Make sure you’re taking a moment to look at everyone present while speaking. Then there are those all-important facial expressions. The key here is self-awareness.

Others strike a power pose and stare the sharks down, a move that’s designed to signal assuredness but ends up revealing arrogance. A wry smile, on the other hand, acknowledges the awkwardness and defuses tension. These impressions matter a great deal.
