In these blinks, you’ll learn Imagine you’re stranded on a desert island. You’re desperately scouring your surroundings for a sign of help when you stumble across something miraculous: an airplane! Upon closer inspection, you see there’s fuel in the tank, and it looks like the motor works. A wave of relief starts to wash over you – only to be interrupted when you realize that you don’t actually know how to fly. And even if you could get the plane off the ground, you’ve no idea where you are! Unfortunately, this is a feeling that most salespeople know well – you’ve probably experienced it yourself any time you’ve come across a seemingly ideal prospect just when you need it most. But just as you need certain skills and a good plan before you can attempt to fly a plane, you have to be fully equipped for each step of your sales journey before you set off. Without a solid strategy, you’ll be leaving it all up to chance. Now, each selling situation is unique depending on what your pitch is, who you’re making it to, and when you’re making it. Yet selling is always a process, and it almost always features the same core elements and pathway. By breaking down the process into steps, you can see exactly what actions you need to take in order to go from acquiring a meeting with a customer to closing a sale, so as to repeat the cycle time and time again until it starts to produce consistent, positive results. That’s where Dale Carnegie’s world-renowned Sales Advantage technique comes in. According to this framework, the sales process starts before you even land a meeting with a potential customer. You need to take three initial steps to earn your prospect’s time: identify who needs your product or service, create a custom pre-approach strategy, and then initiate contact. Something to keep in mind is that at the core of this sales philosophy are your customer’s needs and wants. That means that the sales process is less about tricking a customer into buying from you and more about understanding his perspective in order to land that all-important meeting. But before you can do that, you need to take that first step and seek out new opportunities, as you’ll see in the next blink. Imagine you’re stranded on a desert island.

At first, you poke and prod it to investigate how it works, but honestly, this gets boring pretty quickly. Yet once you start improving, you begin to find the act of playing truly enjoyable. Pretty soon, you're naturally compelled to do it just for fun. Similarly, when it comes to proactively seeking new customers – that is, prospecting – the more you practice, the more pleasant the experience will be. As much as you may dread looking for new prospects, remember that without planting the seeds of new customer relationships, you won't be able to harvest long-term leads. And without practice, you won’t get to the point where you actually enjoy prospecting either. So the very first step of the process is to sell the idea of prospecting to yourself: recognize that being proactive will lead you to close more sales. Make this affirmation to yourself consciously. You may have to tell yourself several times a day before it sinks into your subconscious and translates into your attitude. To make it easier, also come up with a well-defined prospecting strategy that you can practice over time – but make sure it’s manageable. For instance, you may set a goal to make five new contacts every week. Think about it. If you commit to these few more calls a week, by the end of the year you’ll have two hundred more contacts than you started with. But when it comes to new sales opportunities, don’t overlook your existing customer base either. A good way to see if your current customers have other needs that you can meet is to use an opportunity chart.  Take a pen and piece of paper and create a grid. Write down your products or services along the columns on the x-axis – the one that goes from left to right. Then write down your customers along the rows of the up-down y-axis. As you go through the grid, notice where new sales opportunities may overlap with existing customers. When looking at the companies you’re working with, try to identify a prospect there who’s well-respected among peers and already understands the value of what you have to offer. Finally, once you’ve identified who you want to talk to, it’s time to develop a plan of action. Have you ever picked up a musical instrument for the first time?

Finally, once you’ve identified who you want to talk to, it’s time to develop a plan of action. Let’s say you’ve identified your prospect. Wasting no time, you pick up the phone and dial her number. When she answers, you launch right into talking about your company and your offer. So far, so good! But, within the first 15 seconds, she cuts you short; she’s not interested. Before you even have a chance to say goodbye, the line goes dead. This is the worst-case scenario for every salesperson – after all, your main goal at this stage is to grab a prospect’s attention. But then again, how can you know what will interest your customer if you haven’t done your research? In order to determine which opportunities are likely to develop into real prospects, you need to do some investigating – this is what’s known as developing your pre-approach strategy, and it’s one of the most crucial steps to landing a meeting. As the second step of the sales process, the pre-approach is about finding out all you need to know about your prospects to determine whether they’re potential customers. But it’s more than just research: it’s also about connecting with your customers’ needs so you can build a better pitch in the long run. While the information you want to gather during the pre-approach will differ from prospect to prospect, four key steps apply in every sales situation. The first is to make sure you’re absolutely sure about your prospect’s name, title, and contact information. Familiarize yourself with what she prefers to be called and how to pronounce it. Next, determine how exactly she’d benefit or use your product or service: be as specific as possible regarding the solution you’re offering. The third step is to think about your competition in relation to that prospect. From her perspective, where would you stand compared to other salespeople like you? Finally, find out if she’s the decision-maker. That doesn’t mean you should write her off just because she isn’t the decision-maker – as long as she has some influence within the company, she can be of value to you. But it’s important to know where she stands in the sales process, too. If you put the work into the pre-approach, you’ll have more confidence when it comes to getting – and keeping – your prospect’s attention. Let’s say you’ve identified your prospect.

If you put the work into the pre-approach, you’ll have more confidence when it comes to getting – and keeping – your prospect’s attention. If you’re in the lobby of a movie theater, you’ll notice that most movie posters include quotes of praise. Usually, these are from critics who use words like “masterpiece” and “tour-de-force,” and including them is a bid to convince you to watch a particular movie rather than the others on display. What you won’t see is a quote from the director or cast of the movie in question – while you’d expect them to praise it, too, you wouldn’t necessarily take their word for it. That’s why the critics’ quotes are there: they act as a credibility statement. Similarly, when it’s time for you to initiate contact with your prospect, it’s less effective to open with your own opinion. Instead, build credibility about the solution you’re selling by showing your prospect how others in a similar situation have benefited from it. To form a strong credibility statement, combine the insights you gathered during your pre-approach with existing information about your satisfied customers. It should include four specific elements. To illustrate them, let’s say you’re selling storage solutions. In an email, you tell your prospect, “A local logistics company just like yours has increased the number of pallets it moves by 50 percent in the past month.” With this statement, you’ve already added the first two elements – what you’ve done for other companies and how you did it for one similar to your prospect. You’ve not only explained the solution you provided but also backed it up with a clear statistic. Continuing, you write: “Using our storage solutions, our past client was able to create a space utilization program to widen the aisles in its existing space, without incurring any major costs.” See what you’ve done there? Element number three is showing how you’d tailor your solutions for your prospect’s needs. Finally, you end your email with “If you’re interested, I can call you tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. to discuss your company’s storage needs.” This is the fourth element, a commitment to follow up. In addition to setting up the meeting you’ve been aiming for from the start, you’re indicating that you’re ready to respond to this prospect’s unique needs. Ultimately, this is what will really set you apart from other salespeople in the marketplace. After all, when someone pays attention to you, aren't you more likely to notice them, too? If you’re in the lobby of a movie theater, you’ll notice that most movie posters include quotes of praise. Usually, these are from critics who use words like “masterpiece” and “tour-de-force,” and including them is a bid to convince you to watch a particular movie rather than the others on display. What you won’t see is a quote from the director or cast of the movie in question – while you’d expect them to praise it, too, you wouldn’t necessarily take their word for it. That’s why the critics’ quotes are there: they act as a credibility statement. Similarly, when it’s time for you to initiate contact with your prospect, it’s less effective to open with your own opinion. Instead, build credibility about the solution you’re selling by showing your prospect how others in a similar situation have benefited from it.

Ultimately, this is what will really set you apart from other salespeople in the marketplace. After all, when someone pays attention to you, aren't you more likely to notice them, too? Imagine you’re a human resources manager in a manufacturing company. One day, you receive a sales brochure in the mail. Attached is a cover letter opening with, “Dear customer,” followed by information about a recruiting firm’s new technology. Doesn’t sound exactly riveting, does it? Chances are you’d toss it in the recycling right away. Now picture a different scenario. Along with the brochure, you receive a cover letter that addresses you by a nickname you like, and the first sentence reads: “I noticed that you’ve been running recruitment ads for engineers.” That’s exactly what you’ve been doing, so you keep reading, hooked by what the author terms attention-getters. These phrases or actions get your prospect interested in what you’re selling by taking her mind off whatever she’s focused on, and onto what you’re saying. Compliments, for example, are a great attention-getter and an effective way of getting other people’s attention. But be careful not to overdo it. Most people are wary of hearing salespeople offer generic compliments, so if you’re going to make one, hone in on your pre-approach information. For instance, you could say: “Anna, I read about your work at the homeless shelter in the local paper yesterday and I just wanted to say how inspired I was by your initiative.” Questions are another great way to open a conversation – but not just any question. Ask questions that are relevant and specific to your prospect’s needs. If you’ve done your pre-approach homework, you can safely guess what these might be. For instance, you could ask something like: “If there were a way for you to reduce the downtime of your machinery without incurring major costs, you’d probably want to hear about it, right?” A third way to strengthen your chances of being heard is referrals. Beginning a conversation by saying, “Kendra Smith suggested I email you” is a lot more attention-grabbing than opening by introducing your name. When deploying your attention-getting tools, just beware of not putting your prospect off by using too many at once. Just as you wouldn’t wear all of your best suits to a single meeting, be selective about your tactics. Remember that your goal here is to land that all-important meeting.

So you’ve found your opportunity, done your pre-approach, initiated direct communication, and caught your prospect's attention. Now you’ve finally reached the stage of the process where your prospect is willing to meet with you. Congratulations! You’re exactly where you want to be. Now it’s time to improve the odds that your interaction will be effective and enjoyable for everyone involved. During this stage, your goal is similar to during the pre-approach: you want to build on the information you already have in order to find out more about what your prospect wants, including the full specifications of the product or service she needs, and also why she needs it. This is what the author refers to as your prospect’s Dominant Buying Motive. And it will be your key to having leverage over the negotiation process. According to the Sales Advantage principles, the Dominant Buying Motive isn’t a practical reason your customer wants to buy something. Rather, it’s the emotional reward that she looks forward to before making the purchase. For instance, let’s say she needs contact management software; logically, this will help her stay on top of her contact database more efficiently. But her emotional reason – her Dominant Buying Motive – is to feel good about having more time to spend with her family and on her hobbies.  Out of all the reasons to make a purchase, the Dominant Buying Motive is generally the most compelling. One of the graduates of Sales Advantage principles made an appointment with a customer to talk about his investment plans. As she asked questions – based on her pre-approach strategy – she learned about the plans he had for his family. Quickly, she gathered that the customer’s Dominant Buying Motive would be to give him peace of mind about providing long-term security for his family. Once she understood that, she focused her questions on the motive before suggesting that opening another company would lead to greater stability down the line – a solution which he agreed to on the spot. By focusing on your prospect’s emotional motive, you’ll be one step closer to turning your prospect into a customer.

By focusing on your prospect’s emotional motive, you’ll be one step closer to turning your prospect into a customer. When you’re at a store and the cashier asks, “Would you like to pay by cash or card?” there’s a reason he’s not asking an open-ended question like “Would you like to buy these now?” Once you’re at the checkout counter, he can safely assume that you’ve made a commitment to buy and present you with two low-stakes choices. This technique is known as alternative choices and it’s one of many that you can use to nudge a prospect closer to commitment once you’ve landed your meeting. As we've seen, it's not about hard-nosed tactics – sometimes asking the right question is all it takes. In addition to asking your prospect to make one of two low-stake choices, questions that refer to the next step in the sales process can also help you take the meeting beyond the pitch to the sale. For instance, if your prospect expresses interest in your offer but stops short of making an order, you can jump in and say: “When would you like me to schedule the delivery?” Keep in mind, these “next-step questions” shouldn’t be yes or no ones, since you don’t want no for an answer. In other words, avoid questions like “Would next Thursday be a good time to install the machine?” since your prospect may have countless reasons why that day wouldn’t work. During the meeting, it’s also key to pay close attention to your customer’s physical behavior and to keep an eye out for nonverbal buyer signals. These might include the customer appearing relaxed, leaning toward you, or assuming a happy expression. Throughout the meeting, you can test whether you’re interpreting these cues correctly by checking in with your prospect. For instance, you can ask: “How does this sound so far?” or “What are your thoughts?” After all, why not ask a direct question? Once you’ve engaged your prospect, presented your solution and engaged the Dominant Buy Motive, you’ve also earned the right to flat-out ask for a commitment. This might make you nervous. But putting yourself in your customers’ shoes and recognizing that you share the same emotions makes it easier to gather the confidence to come out and ask for commitment.  When you’re at a store and the cashier asks, “Would you like to pay by cash or card?” there’s a reason he’s not asking an open-ended question like “Would you like to buy these now?” Once you’re at the checkout counter, he can safely assume that you’ve made a commitment to buy and present you with two low-stakes choices.

These might include the customer appearing relaxed, leaning toward you, or assuming a happy expression. Throughout the meeting, you can test whether you’re interpreting these cues correctly by checking in with your prospect. For instance, you can ask: “How does this sound so far?” or “What are your thoughts?” After all, why not ask a direct question? Once you’ve engaged your prospect, presented your solution and engaged the Dominant Buy Motive, you’ve also earned the right to flat-out ask for a commitment. This might make you nervous. But putting yourself in your customers’ shoes and recognizing that you share the same emotions makes it easier to gather the confidence to come out and ask for commitment.  When you’re at a store and the cashier asks, “Would you like to pay by cash or card?” there’s a reason he’s not asking an open-ended question like “Would you like to buy these now?” Once you’re at the checkout counter, he can safely assume that you’ve made a commitment to buy and present you with two low-stakes choices. This technique is known as alternative choices and it’s one of many that you can use to nudge a prospect closer to commitment once you’ve landed your meeting. As we've seen, it's not about hard-nosed tactics – sometimes asking the right question is all it takes. In addition to asking your prospect to make one of two low-stake choices, questions that refer to the next step in the sales process can also help you take the meeting beyond the pitch to the sale. For instance, if your prospect expresses interest in your offer but stops short of making an order, you can jump in and say: “When would you like me to schedule the delivery?” Keep in mind, these “next-step questions” shouldn’t be yes or no ones, since you don’t want no for an answer.

Looking at the dashboard, you probably wondered what all the buttons and switches were for. Once you’ve been driving to work every morning for 20 years, this scenario might seem a little silly. That’s because eventually, driving became second nature. Think of handling objections to your sales in the same way. When someone turns you down, the experience can make you feel dejected. But as you acquire the tools to navigate objections as they come up, you’ll gradually become able to turn any objection to your favor. Your immediate response to an objection should be to clarify the reasons behind it. It’s very important to understand the difference between your prospect’s lack of interest in your product or service and her openness to negotiate. The only way to find out is, once again, to ask the right questions. For example, if your customer objects by saying, “I think I’m looking for something else,” you could ask, “What exactly are you looking for?” If the objection is that your price is too high, you could reply, “Why do you think so?” In fact, Dale Carnegie even recommends pushing your clients to share more objections with you. In a lot of cases, the obstacle standing in between your customer and her commitment to buy is hidden from you. The only way for you to access that objection and eliminate it is to ask questions. For example, asking “Is there anything else that causes you to hesitate?” will bring new information to light, which may help you find room for compromise. It’s best to respond to objections on the spot, so come prepared. Take time before the meeting to prepare questions that you can use to bring your customer back to commitment. Of course, it’s even better if you can anticipate an objection before it comes up; to do so, you need to have done your research and gotten to know your customer through every stage of the sale. As long as you remember to view the process from your customer’s point of view from start to finish, you’ll be primed to close the sale.

The key message in these blinks is that: If you want to close sales consistently, you need to follow a repeatable process every time. Before initiating contact with your prospects, make sure you’re proactive about who you’re getting in touch with and put in the work to find out their wants and needs. By approaching the sales process from your customers’ point of view, you’ll be equipped with what it takes to close the deal. And here’s some more actionable advice: Use a trial close to redirect a customer’s objection. Once you’ve handled a customer’s objection and discovered the reasons behind it, use a “trial close” to see whether you can win the customer back by eliminating those reasons. For instance, if your customer’s objection is the proposed schedule, use a trial close by offering: ""But once we adjust our schedule, you’ll be interested, right?""
