If you’re an internet user of any sort, you probably instinctively know what one is. You’ve seen the silly pictures, GIFs, and videos that gain massive traction on social media. You’ve probably even shared one or two. But you might be unfamiliar with how and why the word entered our vocabulary.  To understand that, we have to dig into some science.  The key message here is: The idea of the meme comes from evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins coined the term “meme” in his book The Selfish Gene. He described how genes are the real drivers of evolution. Through the process of natural selection, successful genes manage to pass themselves down from one generation to the next. He called the vehicle for those genes, be it a plant or an animal, a gene machine.  Dawkins also noticed that things like ideas, songs, fashions, and languages are passed down in human society in a similar way to genes. He called these memes.  Like genes, memes go through an evolutionary process. Think of how ideas evolve. The initial idea is conceived by one human being, and then it’s transmitted to another. As it comes into contact with other brains, it mutates and develops. If an idea is attractive, it becomes successful; otherwise, it fizzles out.  And just like genes, memes have to be transmitted through a vehicle. But rather than through the bodies of animals and plants, memes travel through different formats: meme machines.  Take the example of the “Mondays Suck” meme, which is based on the idea that we all hate Mondays because we have to go back to work. It’s obviously a relatable meme, and its success is evident in its many different formats. Numerous GIFs, tweets, and videos carry the Mondays Suck meme throughout the internet.  It has also propagated in other offline ways. For instance, the entire premise of the film Office Space centers on the idea. And, long ago, the Roman emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius dedicated a chapter of his Meditations to this very subject. Through all of these different meme machines, the meme has persisted and spread through our culture. In the next blink, we’ll look at why the machine is just as important as the meme itself.  “Meme.” It’s a word that’s been flying around for a while now.

In the next blink, we’ll look at why the machine is just as important as the meme itself.  Imagine you’re listening to someone tell a joke. In the wrong hands, a good joke can be heavy, dull, and completely fail to make you laugh. But if told by a gifted comedian, even the most clichéd material can be laugh-out-loud funny. It’s all about delivery.  The same is true for memes: the meme machine has to fit the meme. For instance, anyone browsing Reddit or 4chan during the late 2000s and early 2010s would’ve noticed that memes, in the form of images, were always accompanied by words written in the chunky, unsophisticated “Impact” font.  The font was part of an ironic subculture, and the memes just wouldn't have been the same if delivered with a subtle, elegant typescript. The bold nature of the font also meant that the memes survived a decline in image quality through continuous sharing. It was a perfect fit for the content. The key message here is: The format of the meme is as important as the meme. The meme format also has to fit the particular context in which the meme appears. Take, for instance, the medium of video as a meme machine. There are times when you’re more prepared to consume video content than others. For example, during a commercial break on TV, you’re primed to expect video in the form of ads. You’ll passively consume one- or two-minute commercials while waiting for your program to restart. But, when scrolling through Facebook, it’s unlikely that you’ll watch an entire video ad. It’s also unlikely that you’ll specifically unmute your device for a video commercial unless it really piques your interest. So a brand delivering TV-type video content on Facebook might struggle to convey its message. On the other hand, if the video content were delivered with captions, it could be successful. Going a step further, it might be that the content could be delivered most effectively without using video at all. In fact, when advising one brand on its online strategy, the author found that still images attracted by far the most engagement on Facebook. The important lesson here? The medium is as vital as the message!  Imagine you’re listening to someone tell a joke. In the wrong hands, a good joke can be heavy, dull, and completely fail to make you laugh.

For example, during a commercial break on TV, you’re primed to expect video in the form of ads. You’ll passively consume one- or two-minute commercials while waiting for your program to restart. But, when scrolling through Facebook, it’s unlikely that you’ll watch an entire video ad. It’s also unlikely that you’ll specifically unmute your device for a video commercial unless it really piques your interest. So a brand delivering TV-type video content on Facebook might struggle to convey its message. On the other hand, if the video content were delivered with captions, it could be successful. Going a step further, it might be that the content could be delivered most effectively without using video at all. In fact, when advising one brand on its online strategy, the author found that still images attracted by far the most engagement on Facebook. The important lesson here? The medium is as vital as the message!  Imagine you’re listening to someone tell a joke. In the wrong hands, a good joke can be heavy, dull, and completely fail to make you laugh. But if told by a gifted comedian, even the most clichéd material can be laugh-out-loud funny. It’s all about delivery.  The same is true for memes: the meme machine has to fit the meme. For instance, anyone browsing Reddit or 4chan during the late 2000s and early 2010s would’ve noticed that memes, in the form of images, were always accompanied by words written in the chunky, unsophisticated “Impact” font.  The font was part of an ironic subculture, and the memes just wouldn't have been the same if delivered with a subtle, elegant typescript. The bold nature of the font also meant that the memes survived a decline in image quality through continuous sharing. It was a perfect fit for the content.

The medium is as vital as the message!  Online content teams often fall at the first hurdle as they scramble to understand and harness new memes and trends. Their carefully crafted marketing campaigns are ripped apart by savvy online communities, or they just sink without a trace. Worst of all, some brands enter online spaces without really understanding them – like an embarrassing older relative crashing a house party.  But when content is gauged correctly, an advertising campaign can really succeed. So what can brands do to create content that actually works?  The key message here is: To succeed, brand content should bring value, adopt the right format, and employ narrative techniques. First, brands need to focus on bringing value. Rather than simply trying to snag consumers with PR-speak, they should contribute something to the online community. They could create bookmarkable content, which contains useful or instructive information – something like a recipe or a DIY project that incorporates one of the brand’s products.  Or they could deliver badgeworthy content. This is where the brand helps people define themselves in front of their own social network. The person might be trying to communicate that they use and love the brand’s eco-friendly fabrics, or believe in a current issue that the brand is associated with. Second, brands should ensure that the format they choose helps the user get the most out of the content. Take the example of a recipe. Rather than attaching a link to a social media post, which would require extra effort to access, it’d be best if the recipe were contained within an image file. That way, the user gets the information they need quickly and can share the content conveniently.  Third, brands should use narrative elements to create a personal connection. That’s because personal stories drive more engagement than impersonal details. People scroll through their social media feeds for relatable content, not glib marketing campaigns.  As human beings, we’re also deeply wired to pay more attention to information when it’s a narrative related to a single individual. For instance, charities have found that the story of a little homeless girl attracts more sympathy – and donations – than information about homelessness in general. Brands can apply the same approach. Take a how-to video explaining how to finish a DIY project. If that video shows the personal struggle and triumph of an individual person, then users are much more likely to follow and share the story.

Each of your social media platforms has its own specific tone. Think about your Instagram posts – how do they compare to those on Twitter? And your Facebook profile is probably nothing like your Reddit profile. It’s as if you’re taking on different personas across the various platforms. The author believes that this corresponds to Sigmund Freud’s model of the mind. In this model, Freud suggests that the mind is made up of an id, a superego, and an ego. The id is your chaotic, unconscious instincts and desires. Then, the superego embodies all your learned cultural rules and ideals. Finally, the ego, which is the conscious “center” of your mind, has to mediate between these two sides. In the author’s view, you engage these different parts of the mind on different platforms.  The key message here is: Freudian psychoanalysis reveals how we engage different personas across different social media platforms. First, the id manifests in the way that you use social networks like Reddit or 4chan. Users have anonymous handles on those platforms, and they’re able to explore sides to themselves that haven’t found expression in their offline lives. You can explore interests, desires, and identities that you haven’t integrated into your everyday, physical life – all without anyone you know watching. The superego, on the other hand, corresponds to the way you use sites like Instagram. The superego is where you conceive yourself in relation to society. So when you use Instagram, you’re showcasing an idealized version of yourself to the world.  While you might have offline friends on Instagram, you’re also connected to countless others who don’t know you in real life. So you present your best self – you’re a bit slicker, wittier, more filtered. And when you post vacation snaps on Instagram, you only show the best bits – the glorious sunsets, the beautiful hotel lobbies, the mouthwatering food.  The last piece of the puzzle – the ego – manifests in the way you use social networks like Facebook and Snapchat: how you present yourself to your offline friends and family. This is a version of yourself that is consistent with who you are offline, in contrast to the anonymous user on the id networks or the idealized self of the superego networks. Because the ego is the conscious center of yourself, your profiles on these websites are most reflective of the life you actually lead.  For instance, rather than the highly curated Instagram vacation posts, on Facebook you’d upload a whole album. It’d feature both the good and not-so-good bits – a terrible airport meal or the time you got locked out of the hotel room.  Each of your social media platforms has its own specific tone.

It’s not enough to have a blanket marketing approach across all platforms. Posting content meant for Instagram simply won’t cut it on Reddit – and vice versa.  So let’s first consider the way brands should engage with people on ego networks – the sites like Facebook or Snapchat. To recap, this is where you present a version of yourself that’s consistent with your offline life. You’re mostly interacting with others who know you in person, which brands should be sensitive to.  The key message here is: On ego networks, create opportunities for self-expression and connection with offline friends. Let’s begin with an example that’s had great success with Facebook content – Dove, the personal care brand. In a 2013 video ad, a forensic artist drew women’s faces based purely on their self-descriptions. Then he drew them again, but this time based on descriptions by other women. In the first version, the artist drew them with all of their minute flaws exaggerated; in the second, they’re depicted in a way that’s much closer to how they actually look. The ad ends with the line, “You are more beautiful than you think.” It’s a moving piece, and Facebook users loved it. They shared it hundreds of thousands of times in the first few days after its launch. And even though it was a three-minute video – something that doesn’t often succeed on Facebook – it resonated with people who felt it represented them. Importantly, it brought value to the users who were able to connect with family and friends who also agreed with the message. Dove understood that on platforms like Facebook, this kind of content would drive the most engagement.  But ego network content doesn’t always need to be so emotive. There are other ways to help people represent themselves and connect with others. For instance, Ziploc, the reusable storage bag company, released a series of “life hack” posts, which demonstrated how to use Ziploc products in surprising ways. Their top posts had titles like “Pecan Pie Chocolate Bark” and “Cheesecake Stuffed Strawberries.”  These posts prompted people to share them with friends, with comments like, “Let’s try this next time!” or “Wouldn’t this be fun?” It was a neat way to showcase Ziploc products while prompting connections and allowing people to own the content in a way that reflected them personally.  To succeed, brands need to understand how people behave across different social networks.

Their top posts had titles like “Pecan Pie Chocolate Bark” and “Cheesecake Stuffed Strawberries.”  These posts prompted people to share them with friends, with comments like, “Let’s try this next time!” or “Wouldn’t this be fun?” It was a neat way to showcase Ziploc products while prompting connections and allowing people to own the content in a way that reflected them personally.  To succeed, brands need to understand how people behave across different social networks. It’s not enough to have a blanket marketing approach across all platforms. Posting content meant for Instagram simply won’t cut it on Reddit – and vice versa.  So let’s first consider the way brands should engage with people on ego networks – the sites like Facebook or Snapchat. To recap, this is where you present a version of yourself that’s consistent with your offline life. You’re mostly interacting with others who know you in person, which brands should be sensitive to.  The key message here is: On ego networks, create opportunities for self-expression and connection with offline friends. Let’s begin with an example that’s had great success with Facebook content – Dove, the personal care brand. In a 2013 video ad, a forensic artist drew women’s faces based purely on their self-descriptions. Then he drew them again, but this time based on descriptions by other women. In the first version, the artist drew them with all of their minute flaws exaggerated; in the second, they’re depicted in a way that’s much closer to how they actually look. The ad ends with the line, “You are more beautiful than you think.” It’s a moving piece, and Facebook users loved it. They shared it hundreds of thousands of times in the first few days after its launch. And even though it was a three-minute video – something that doesn’t often succeed on Facebook – it resonated with people who felt it represented them. Importantly, it brought value to the users who were able to connect with family and friends who also agreed with the message. Dove understood that on platforms like Facebook, this kind of content would drive the most engagement.  But ego network content doesn’t always need to be so emotive. There are other ways to help people represent themselves and connect with others. For instance, Ziploc, the reusable storage bag company, released a series of “life hack” posts, which demonstrated how to use Ziploc products in surprising ways.

We curate our lives heavily on these platforms because the whole world can see us – not just the people who know us offline. Consciously or not, we mostly present event highlights, positive moments, and idealistic beliefs.  To appeal to people on superego networks requires content that is badgeworthy and aspirational. Take, for example, fashion content – something that has had great success on Instagram. When someone engages with a post by Nike, they’re defining their ideal self as athletic. On the other hand, if they engage with a small, local clothing brand, they’re defining their ideal self as offbeat, ethical, and fashionable. The key message here is: To drive engagement on superego networks, align with people’s ideal selves. As well as being badgeworthy, content on superego networks also has to add value to the network. A great example of impactful badgeworthy content was the Beats By Dre “Straight Outta Somewhere” campaign. While Dre Beats are fashionable status symbols, the Straight Outta Somewhere campaign also connected with people’s personal identities.  It drew on a simple insight – that is, just like Dre, everyone is proud to represent their hometown. So the brand created a special website, www.StraightOuttaSomewhere.com, where visitors could showcase their hometowns by uploading a photo with the iconic “Straight Outta Compton” graphic. The campaign was a roaring success, and people from all over the world personalized the format. Although badgeworthy content is most suited to superego networks, it doesn’t mean that bookmarkable content can’t thrive too. Recipe and “kitchen hack” content is very popular on Instagram, which brands can use to their advantage. That’s because bookmarkable content can help people represent their ideal selves too – by learning about great recipes, they can aspire to be a great chef, for instance.  Take the @buzzfeedtasty Instagram account. It posts recipe hacks and how-tos and has more than 34 million followers! Their short videos generate millions of views in no time at all. That’s bookmarkable success.  As we now know, superego networks are where we present an idealized self; these are platforms like Instagram or TikTok.

That’s bookmarkable success.  On id networks like Reddit and 4chan, all that users have to identify themselves are nicknames – often comic handles like “drunkwombat92” or “lovetacos123.” These are websites where individual identity and representation aren’t a big deal. The important thing is the community. Compare Reddit with Instagram, for example. On Instagram, users present a highly individualistic version of themselves – selfies, snaps of their meals, their vacations, etc. On Reddit, they join groups called “subreddits” and discuss their favorite subjects with other anonymous users. Most Reddit users don’t even have a profile picture, just a customizable avatar.  Everything is about the group, not the self.  The key message here is: To succeed with id networks, focus on fostering an authentic online community. Networks like Reddit and 4chan are united by shared interests, so they prioritize quality content and discussion. They’re often also discerning and skeptical communities that are looking for value – not pushy or promotional behavior. In fact, there’s a whole subreddit dedicated to mocking bad advertising campaigns – r/AdvertisingFails – where users comment on clumsy attempts to sell something.  So, it’d seem that these communities were no-go areas for brand content, right? Well, not exactly. If brands are able to engage with and understand the community as a whole, they can foster productive relationships with them.  Take the example of UNIQLO, the Japanese clothing company. After noticing some posts about UNIQLO on Reddit, the company built up a presence on the site. But rather than hire a big content team, they assigned one e-commerce manager to the task. This was Arielle Dyda, who simply posted in fashion subreddits as herself. By engaging in a personal, frank, and unpolished way, Dyda was able to build a deep relationship with the Reddit community.  When there were complaints about UNIQLO that seemed unfair, Dyda would even confront the complainant rather than shy away and take the “customer is always right” approach. To many, it was refreshing. And the result was that UNIQLO became something of a cult brand for Redditors. In PR terms, it was a total success! The upshot here is that brands should connect with users on websites like Reddit on their level. On these anonymous networks, people tend to be transparent, candid, and personal. Brands need to be the same.  Whether it’s on id, superego, or ego networks, brands need to dig a little deeper and get to know what drives people to act the way they do.

They also have to be sensitive to the different ways that users interact with different platforms. Reddit is not the same Instagram, and that should be reflected in the content. Freud’s model of the mind – the id, superego, and ego – roughly corresponds to the different types of social networks: the anonymous-community space, the idealized-self space, and the offline-life space.
