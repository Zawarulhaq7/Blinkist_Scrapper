0,The Storytelling Edge,Shane Snow and Joe Lazauskas,"The Storytelling Edge (2018) is a study of communication by two content strategists who’ve taken an old Native American proverb to heart – “those who tell the stories run the world.” As Shane Snow and Joe Lazauskas assert, it doesn’t much matter if you’re an individual, a business, or a government: if you want to thrive in today’s world, you need to be able to tell your story as convincingly and fluently as possible.","Joe Lazauskas is the director of content strategy and editor-in-chief of Contently, a global tech company that helps Fortune 500 companies create compelling stories. Contently was founded by Lazauskas’ co-author, Shane Snow. Both are trained wordsmiths with backgrounds in journalism.   © Shane Snow and Joe Lazauskas: The Storytelling Edge copyright 2018, John Wiley & Sons Inc.

That’s because storytelling engages more parts of our brains than abstract language does. Whether it’s Star Wars or a Hemingway novel, the best stories tap into this evolutionary trait by emphasizing relatability, novelty, tension, and fluency. But effective storytelling isn’t just about what’s on the page or on the screen. To influence your audience, you need to pay attention to how you’re delivering your message. In today’s information-packed world, the best way of doing that is to emphasize quality rather than quantity.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

What to read next: The Science of Storytelling, by Will Storr  Literature and science are often depicted as two entirely different kinds of things. The first, it’s sometimes argued, is subjective and “fuzzy,” whereas the second is objective and factual. But does this distinction really hold? Is there nothing more to literature than personal taste and the whims of authors? Will Storr doesn’t think so. In a fascinating study of the science behind stories, Storr draws on cutting-edge neuroscientific research to illuminate the inner workings of everything from Harry Potter to Greek drama to Breaking Bad.
