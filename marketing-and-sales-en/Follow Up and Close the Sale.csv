In these blinks, you’ll learn The author, Jeff Shore, was at a networking event when a ghostwriter pitched an amazing business deal he’d never considered before. She wanted him to hire her company to write his next book. From a sales perspective, she did everything right. She helped her customer identify a problem – that he’s always short on time. Then she gave him a solution, her company’s services, to get some time back. With visions of more time in his future, Shore was intrigued! He’d never thought to hire out his writing, but the prospect of more time made him a prime candidate to close the deal – which didn’t happen. The ghostwriter took three long weeks to follow up, and by then, he’d moved on. Winning a sale is a lot of work, but losing one is all too easy. The key message here is: A buyer’s emotional journey is short, so don’t wait too long before following up.  By reminding Shore of the value of his time, the ghostwriter raised his dissatisfaction levels with his current situation. He hadn’t thought about it before, but afterward, he couldn’t stop thinking about how much he’d love some time back. On top of that, the ghostwriter gave him a strong sense of future promise; he could buy himself time by using her services. That sounded great! The ghostwriter succeeded in raising Shore’s emotional altitude. She left him feeling bad about his current situation, but jubilant about how it could change for the better. This heightened mix of emotions began to outweigh his fears and doubts about the cost, or other downsides, of buying her services. So far, so good. All the ghostwriter had to do was pick up the phone the next day and capitalize on the author’s emotional altitude. But when she didn’t, something else happened instead. Shore climbed down from his emotional peak. During the next three weeks, his busy life swept him away from their discussion. He completely forgot how the ghostwriter had made him feel. He no longer felt dissatisfaction with his current situation and lost excitement for her time-saving solution. So, when the ghostwriter eventually followed up, his doubts and fears outweighed all the feelings she’d managed to generate in him. In those three precious weeks, she’d allowed his emotional altitude to fizzle, missing her chance to make an easy sale.

But it seems like many salespeople haven't gotten the memo. In fact, the average salesperson doesn’t follow up more than twice, and 92 percent of salespeople give up after talking to someone four times. That’s an awful lot of missed opportunities. So, why do so many salespeople give up so easily? It all comes down to resistance. Resistance is the powerful psychological force that stops you from making that next follow-up call. It's the little voice in your head that tells you to spend the morning surfing YouTube, and leave your difficult sales calls for later. Resistance is what keeps you procrastinating, making excuses, and distracting you from what needs to be done. The key message here is: Avoid missed opportunities by overcoming your psychological resistance to following up. So, where does resistance come from? It's a hard-wired biological instinct at the root of your comfort addiction. In other words, it reacts to anything that makes you feel discomfort. Resistance will always drive you to choose the easier road over the challenging one. After all, it's more comfortable to stream something on YouTube than to make follow-up calls. For salespeople, telephobia, fear of closing the deal, objections, and fear of rejection are just a few things that make the business of selling uncomfortable and triggers resistance. Every time you ask a customer for the sale, you’re vulnerable to the ultimate rejection – the discomfort of hearing them say no. But to be part of the top one percent of salespeople, you need to be bold and overcome resistance, turning it on its head until it becomes achievement. By crushing your own resistance, you’ll be one of the few salespeople to access low-hanging fruit – a customer who wants to give you a yes but needs to be asked more times than other salespeople are willing to do. Resistance is so powerful that waiting until you’re faced with it allows your primitive, comfort-addicted brain to succumb to it. Instead, decide to do all the things you’ve been resisting before your brain has a chance to backtrack. So, when you’re sitting at your desk first thing in the morning, you’ve already decided to devote the first part of your day to follow-up calls. Waiting until you're staring at the phone to make that decision could lead to more of those missed opportunities. Research shows that buyers tend to say no four times before saying yes.

Waiting until you're staring at the phone to make that decision could lead to more of those missed opportunities. Every salesperson wants to close the sale right off the bat, but the reality is that you’re better served thinking about following up during the initial meeting. Though you should definitely ask for the sale, be prepared for a broader conversation for the buyer who needs more time. If you think of it as a longer conversation with more than one stage, you’re able to take the right information from that initial meeting and create a stronger follow-up. Every time you connect with your customers, it allows you to give them a personal touch that shows that you care. Even if it takes more than one, two, or even three follow-ups, each one gets you closer to the sale while keeping your buyers’ emotional attitude at full flight. The key message here is: Use notes from your initial meeting to show prospects you care. Let’s say that you’re trying to sell a house to a busy single mother with several children. During your first meeting, she boasts about her kids enjoying karate – a note you diligently write down. But what does karate have to do with selling this mom a house? Well, if she doesn’t put in an offer right away, you have the perfect opportunity to reach out the next day. After a quick search, you can send her a list of karate schools in the area as a subtle follow-up with a personal touch. This action lets her know that you heard what she needs and you care about getting it for her much more than any other real estate agent. This service-based approach gives you an opportunity to build an emotional relationship with your customer. In fact, research shows that buying is an emotional decision that buyers justify with logic after the decision has been made. So, by using notes from each follow-up, you’re able to personalize the buying experience for maximum impact – something a generic email simply can’t compete with. Taking notes at the first sales meeting also helps beyond showing how much you care. It gives you an opportunity to summarize how your product could help with all your customer’s goals, needs, and doubts. Following up with this summary gives your prospect a sense of why the product is useful, while adding a request to discuss further gives you the next opportunity to close the sale.

The business of selling is a challenge, but so is the business of buying. Think of the last time you were in the market for an extravagant purchase, like a new flat-screen TV. Like most people, you probably did a little research – browsing options at Costco and reading reviews on Amazon, for example. Suddenly, the choices become overwhelming. Which brand do you buy? What seller should you buy it from? And why? How many pixels does a screen really need anyway? With all these choices, it's no wonder it’s difficult for buyers to make a decision. And they need a way to simplify their options. So, they engage in a process of elimination. And your job as a salesperson is to make sure your product doesn’t get eliminated. The key message here is: Buyers will simplify their options by eliminating unmemorable ones and those that seem difficult.  When buyers are faced with an overwhelming number of options, it results in cognitive strain. There’s just too much information for the brain to process. That’s when a buyer rules out a few options by deciding on which choices they definitely won’t buy. How does this happen? Well, the process of elimination isn’t as logical as you might think. In fact, when it comes to deciding which options are better than others, a buyer is most likely to go with whichever feels easy. This is because, to the human brain, what’s easy feels right. So, let’s consider a TV-buying prospect. He might eliminate a brand because of its confusing website, underwhelming product display, or harsh colors. On the other hand, he won’t eliminate options that come with a seamless buying experience. And he’ll strongly consider televisions whose sales reps are easy to talk to – and call when they say they will. So, to avoid elimination, make sure you put in the hard work of simplifying the sale, so your customer doesn’t have to. Oftentimes, this process of elimination happens subconsciously. Your prospects simply forget about your product. It’s not intentional; it's just that your product isn’t on their minds anymore. But by following up, not just once, but again and again, you avoid this passive elimination. It's the only way to ensure your product sticks in their minds and makes the final cut.

You know the importance of the follow-up, but how should you go about it? Should you follow up with a face-to-face meeting, a phone call, or maybe even a recorded video message? Most sales professionals tend to choose the option that’s most comfortable, which is usually email. But this is a dangerous approach. Email seems to be the most non-intrusive and less awkward way to communicate. You don’t have to worry about putting a customer on the spot, and you’re able to avoid hearing the dreaded no. Unfortunately, the written form is no substitute for a face-to-face meeting or a phone call. Shore argues that you should barely think of email as a communication medium at all. The key message here is: Face-to-face communication is best, and the telephone is a close second.  Communication in sales is all about two-way interaction. But when you simply write to someone, it's only one way; you’re not continuing a dialogue, at all. And here’s the real problem with emailing as a follow-up: it lacks emotion. Words on a page are cold and clinical; it's really difficult to convey the necessary warmth for the customer, or enthusiasm for the product. And since the business of buying is a deeply emotional process, your follow-up is most effective when it allows for an emotional exchange in your communication. And that’s exactly what you get when you communicate face-to-face. In fact, studies have shown that people pay much more attention to the tone of your voice and your facial expression than the actual words you say. After all, your tone and expressions communicate your emotions. So if you can lock down a face-to-face follow-up session, go for it! But if you can’t, then the telephone is your best bet; you can still use your tone of voice to emotionally connect. So when is email an appropriate form of follow-up? The answer is, when you have a large amount of dense information to convey. Even then, you should include this information in the form of an attachment rather than in the body of your email. The modern world has shrunk our attention spans, and too much text in an email is a surefire way to get it sent to the delete bin.

But that doesn’t mean you should give up. Shore had that happen to him a few years ago when he was about to purchase a top-of-the-range mountain bike. The salesperson thought the deal was in the bag, but then, Shore had an accident. With his leg injured, the bike was no longer a smart choice. He stopped returning the salesperson’s calls. Once the salesperson learned about the accident, he never followed up again. But he gave up too soon. According to Shore, there’s an awful lot of potential in old leads – those prospects that were once highly interested in your products, but never bought it. All too often, salespeople simply write them off. The key message here is: Situations change, so if someone nearly bought from you before, they might buy from you now.  When Shore picked up the injury, his emotional altitude over the mountain bike plummeted. His doubts quickly overrode the strong positive emotions he once had about buying it. He knew he was out of the market . . . for now. Within a few months, his leg got better and his doubts about buying the bike lessened. All he needed was the right nudge to get back in the market. It would’ve been the perfect time for the salesperson to give him that call. His injury was temporary, but the author’s mountain bike needs were still there. He still had dissatisfaction about his situation. He also had the sense of future promise that drew him to the mountain bike in the first place. All the salesperson needed to do was reach out and see how his leg was doing. But he never did. So how can you reconnect with an old lead? Think creatively. Instead of hopping on a call, go for something more personal. After all, you already have a relationship with this person. Shore suggests sending a handwritten note with a specific reason for getting back in touch. Maybe your customer couldn't afford your product in the past, but you’d like to tell them about a new financing plan that would bring their monthly payments down. Whether they’re interested in your offering or not, most people will be touched that you cared enough to write to them. And, as we’ve already seen, when it comes to sales, the one who cares, wins.

The key message in these blinks is that: No deal is won or lost in the first sales meeting. It’s what you do after the initial contact that counts. You might get a lot of nos, before getting a yes. But that just means that the top 1 percent of salespeople have the courage to keep in touch, keep asking, and keep following up until they close the sale. And here’s some more actionable advice: Speed matters. When your prospects reach out to you, how quickly do you get back to them? Probably not as quickly as you should. Studies show that we’re much more likely to buy from someone who’s quick to respond to us. Why? Because when a salesperson engages in fast communication, we make all kinds of assumptions. We assume we can trust them, that they like us, and that they care about us. So if you want to make a winning emotional connection with your customers, get back to them now, not later. Got feedback?
